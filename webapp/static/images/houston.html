I was at your house and as soon as I saw you I got the biggest erection in my pants I have ever had. You had some very beautiful blonde hair and your breasts were georgeous, especially your cleavage. You were not real skinny, i like avg to thick anyways and you had a big nice looking ass. As I was under your sink you walked by alot. I was thinking how it would be if you just took a seat on my lap as I was lying there. I was being professional so no way was I going to say a word. You sure were bending down alot. It was almost like you knew I loved your cleavage and if you would have said something to assure it I would have gave you an amazing day and or night. Was not sure if you were married. The things were in your name. In this business you see alot and I am honest I have had sex with a woman before while fixing her pipes. Lol. We jumped in her pool in the backyard and had sex in the hot tub.

You were wearing a white hat, white tank top, and plaid shorts. I caught you looking at me, but I don&#39;t think you caught me looking. I pulled into a gas pump close to you and started to clean my windshield. Apparently you decided you&#39;d clean yours, and even made the comment, when I glanced your way, that I was copying you (in a playful manner). I sensed you wanted to talk but you didn&#39;t make your move. So this is the only move I can make. Don&#39;t know if you even know about this site but figured I&#39;d try anyway. I can&#39;t remember the name of the gas station but it&#39;s semi new, on the corner of Queenston and W Little York. I&#39;d like to talk to you, if you&#39;re even single. You have a killer smile!

If I&#39;m right though, you were doing things to make sure I was looking ;). We are both going out of town this weekend. Tell me where we&#39;re going, tell me my name, tell me anything that shows me it&#39;s really you and let&#39;s go from there. I would tell you all of this face to face if I wasn&#39;t worried about it affecting my job but I&#39;m 99% sure you want me too! P.s you told me you had 8 tattoos which really got me wondering where the rest of them are ;)</div>                 ')[0];

Lighten up. Why all the name calling? It is unlikely a doctor will lose his license over an affair. AMA violations and punishments are peer reviewed. He &#39;could&#39; lose his license but it is unlikely. More realistic is a fine. But I don&#39;t have a dog in this race so I&#39;m not taking sides or anything. To answer the OP - It does happen more than you may hear about but I wouldn&#39;t call it common. Discretion is key. Good luck.</div>                 ')[0];

I never knew about this little corner of the internet until my friend told me I should post here just to get this off my chest and hopefully take the edge off! I&#39;m infatuated with my Doctor. He is the first person I have ever been interested in that I was not attracted to physically at first. I&#39;m fascinated by his mind and am impressed with just how brilliant he is. He&#39;s married and I am as well, so along with all the other obstacles of anything ever happening between us; that can be added to the list. He is a specialist so I see him more than I would a regular family Dr and maybe it is because of that that I have been thinking about him more and more. I realize it&#39;s quite common for people to have a crush on their Dr and I thought that&#39;s all it was at first but I&#39;m aware now that it is far more than that. I&#39;m legitimately attracted to this man. I have gone out of my way to keep my attraction hidden and to be completely professional with him as to not make for any awkward situations for either of us but on my last visit I got the feeling he was actually flirting with me a bit. It&#39;s like he caught himself, too because he very abruptly stood up, ended our conversation and left the room. I do not want to lose him as my Dr because he truly is a very gifted physician but I don&#39;t know how to hide my attraction much longer. This is essentially a Dr that will treat me for several years (No, he is not a therapist or psychiatrist!!). I know it&#39;s unethical for a Dr to have an affair with a patient and I&#39;m aware of the sanctions that can happen as a result. But is it really that unheard of? Are there more undercover Dr/patient affairs going on than we tend to hear about? I&#39;m quite sure if he were willing, I wouldn&#39;t think twice.</div>                 ')[0];

I have cut out pretty much all of my friends, instead focusing on church and family. (By family I mean my daughter.. I&#39;m in the process of getting divorced) I made the horrific mistake of entrusting myself and all that I encompass into a small network of people. I&#39;m the one everyone goes to when they have problems, from suicidal souls to the homeless, I&#39;ve tried my best to be as available and helpful as I could be. In all this, I&#39;m not cutting it financially, I&#39;m really struggling just to survive monthly. Psychologically I&#39;m burnt out, and it has began to manifest itself physically, I&#39;m fairly confident I have developed an ulcer, and (though I have always had issues with my back and shoulders..) the pain in my neck and shoulder has become unbearable from waking up to going to bed, I&#39;m writhing in pain. Today I started to cry in church. I don&#39;t know why. Though things have been in shambles for pretty much my whole life (the last 3 years have been especially brutal) I tend to maintain a certain level of composure. But the tears flowed out nevertheless, exposing my true vulnerability and weakness. As any loving church family would do, people started to approach me attempting to comfort me. Usually I would accept, but this time I didn&#39;t want to talk. I didn&#39;t want to be cheered up. I wanted to have one moment where I could just be. Just grieve. Grieve for my failed marriage. For my loveless life. For the empty promises, for the promises that haven&#39;t yet been fulfilled. I didn&#39;t say this to anyone, though, opting instead to claim I wished my family was complete. (Which truthfully is a big part of what bothers me from day to day) Then as most well-meaning church goers do, the examination started. &#34;Well if God isn&#39;t blessing you, then you must be doing something wrong.. seek the kingdom of God, and all things will be added to you&#34; (I study ALOT and pray ALOT) but of course that&#39;s not good enough either, as my well-meaning friend tells me, &#34;well, I know you are studying a lot, but you need to worship God more.&#34; She&#39;s probably right. Lol. I just have to &#34;try harder and try harder and try harder&#34; right? Then comes the next platitude I despise almost as much as the first.. &#34;you have to have faith, you have to REALLY believe&#34; (implying that I don&#39;t. The miracles that I&#39;ve seen make it impossible to not believe. In fact, I don&#39;t just believe, I KNOW, my Lord will provide and bless me, restore my family, with help finding a new better husband, and help finding a new job that I will love.) (Because God loves me, not because I&#39;m trying to be a &#39;good person&#39; or because I&#39;m studying everyday or because I dance for Him) Again, they just can&#39;t understand why I&#39;m sad that things aren&#39;t going well. The truth is its because I never really allow myself to feel the immense pain of life, and it made them uncomfortable to see me break without being able to help. They want to fix me. Then starts &#34;everything is going to be okay, (while they think to themselves.. &#39;now cheer up!&#39;) &#34;Which i respond with &#34;yeah I know, yeah I know&#34; Those aren&#39;t empty words, I do know.. just let me freaking feel for a second the crushing weight of my current situation rather than live in this perpetual state of denial. My subconscious is aware of my issues and if I keep repressing my feelings I&#39;m going to have a mental breakdown. Period. I can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve heard people say, &#34;I&#39;ve prayed for healing, but I haven&#39;t been healed..&#34; then watch as the fear of their faith failing them makes them think they deserve the sickness they have because they don&#39;t believe enough. It&#39;s sad. This ideology drives people away from church. God heals who He wants to heal, when he wants to heal them. God provides for His people when He wants to provide for them. It&#39;s not up to us. Does it mean we stop praying? Never! Does it mean we stop hoping? Never! But the church needs to understand that not allowing people to feel how they feel, or worse making them feel guilty for feeling how they feel, or even worse, telling them that it&#39;s because they aren&#39;t trying hard enough (and that&#39;s why they feel the way they feel) will insult the souls of those who are already heavy burdened, and need to look to God and say, only You can do this, there really is nothing I can do. Holding it all in leads to plastering on a fake smile, and pretending everything is okay, when it&#39;s not. That facade leads to unresolved feelings. Those unresolved feelings lead to bitterness. Bitterness leads to a hardened and cold heart which leads to apostasy. I, as of right now, don&#39;t have a desire to step foot in that church again. I&#39;ll still suck it up as I always do and return on Wednesday, just to have my faith questioned again, just to have people be &#39;concerned&#39; about me again. Just to take my place as an injured dog again. In need of pity and a stroking &#34;it&#39;s okay, be a good girl now&#34; Maybe I&#39;m being to harsh because truthfully I know their intentions come from a good place. I just feel judged and discouraged and sick of it all. Why? Because I haven&#39;t anywhere else to go. I exchanged my friends for my church, I have exchanged my sights on worldly things for God. And I know He&#39;s present in that church. Ive been feeling a loss of identity now that I&#39;ve axed premarital sex, drugs, and alcohol from my life, which used to be very closely tied in with my identity. If I leave the church I run the risk of completely Losing Myself.</div>                 ')[0];

I don&#39;t care if your Gay, Straight, Bi, Trans or what just be respectful of meabd my sexuality lol I just recently moved to conroe a couple of months ago, it would be nice to finally go out and hangout with someone/people my age in and around town. I do love to have fun, but don&#39;t take that as I&#39;m a party animal. I do drink but not very much, not because I&#39;m a light weight but because I am past the whole binge drinking stage lol someone around my age and my part of town with similar interests and values would be preferable. I&#39;m a 23-year old Hispanic guy who leads a pretty quiet yet somehow very busy life and enjoys normal activities - dinner, good conversation, books, movies, etc. I love to entertain! so having you come over would not be a problem as long as its on a day I have off.

Is there any love for me left in you? I know it&#39;s selfish but I wish you hadn&#39;t married her. You and i got along so well. I still have the gold ring you gave me on my 16th birthday. I have not met anyone else because I still wait for you. We saw each other at a taqueria a few years back and you were sitting with her, your wife. I had to fight the urge of running to your arms and escaping together, just the two of us. You saw me too but couldn&#39;t fathom to look me in the eye. You did however, looked unbearably disappointed and sad. A good friend of us told me you regret being with her, that you wished you had chosen to be with me instead. That sparked a ray of hope that some day you and i will find ourselves in love again. Daniel I love you. I wish you the best of happiness even if we&#39;re not together at all.

Has a ponytail . Also, there is this bald guy, don&#39;t know where he is Latino or white. I&#39;m sure you will recognize him , he is always talking out loud, he probably has some sort of mental illness. He is always mad at people and would talk shit to you . Simply because he wants to be the only one cruising . Very funny to watch this queer with this bitchy attitude . Another is a tall , very athletic , black bold man. Ugh , this one always cruising and he thinks he is the shit. Oh, and memorable mentions, the ex lifeguard drake . Athletic white , good look g guy. I believe he is no longer at the y but this queer, such a whore . Last time I know, he got caught fucking a Latino kid in the steam room and was pissed off at the people who caught him. Ha, imagine that . And lots of lots of married straight^ who always are looking around . Very funny to watch these all people around . Waiting in the steam and sauna for new meat .

But the violence is just not acceptable .. :( And yet my love for you is undying.. 6 years now since we split, and we still keep our old patterns.. All i ever wanted was to be chill with you, be a family.. i craved shared friends. and you just didn&#39;t deem it all as important. what hurt most was being excluded from every holiday, you even forgot my birthday half of the time. you were busy and stressed and i made it all about you. i was happy to do that at that time. but u couldn&#39;t handle my love, i am your first and you have no experience. your parents didn&#39;t give u a good example of partnership too.. my neither.. so at the end we just never could build something mature. i am happy i am able to love someone on this earth the way i do love you, i love intense feelings.. and i never asked for anything in return. but u love to make it drama, talk about giving you space.. I never not gave you space, all u got was space.. i was boyfriend on demand.. and i was ok with it, cause i thought it helps you. but then came the abuse.. verbal.. physical.. the box of Pandora was opened.. you just lost respect and weren&#39;t man enough to let me go.. kept me around , basking in my love.. and i forgave and forgave and forgave.. we fought , i fucked strangers to kill my pain whenever we separated.. u couldn&#39;t understand why i do it, i explained to you so many times. every-time we fight my soul was ripped apart.. and as much as i like to add fuel to a fight, you were the one starting them out of nowhere, as i know now, just so i go away for a while and u can cheat and lie to some other boy.. ur inability not being able to have sex with strangers that u r so proud of, yes it makes you healthier than me.. but you having affairs, and tell boys you love them and then drop them and come back to me.. thats what i cant understand.. the grass is always greener for you.. and we kept forgiving each other, and moving on each time.. sometimes i think u never trusted me, my brutal honesty, you think its and act.. cause u have the need to cheat and lie and hide, you think everybody is like that. i told you few times, i never ever cheated on you.. till now my love for you is still greater than for anybody else.. i am trapped for 11 years now. and whenever i date u come and sabotage.. and i let you.. and now u r dating for 2 years already.. and in our friendship your favorite thing is to trash your boyfriend.. i told you its the worst dinner conversation. and yet you keep doing it.. how can i stay friends with u? especially that it also lets me know how u trashed me all these years, no wonder none of your friends ever showed respect to me. when we met u were so pure, u needed me, u were innocent, you were stressed, you wanted to jump start your sexuality. you chose me for sex only as i understand now... but how many hundreds of hours you spent telling me otherwise, how u admire me, and all i do, and my personality.. like a true sociopath you calculated what u think i needed to hear.. i don&#39;t think u still understand my personality, how immune i am to compliments or critisism.. i am sure i told you, but u don&#39;t listen, you just pretend you do.. and u do it so well, listening for hundreds of hours to my stories, my philosophies, my opinions.. just giving generic nods. yes i am a fool for not seeng that.. i am just not used to be scammed, especially not by someone i love.. hundreds of deeds over the years were committed by you to show me how profoundly you disrespect me. no opportunity was spared to show me my place on the totem pole with your family and friends. no chance spared to put them between us. use them as an excuse why you cant be there for me when i need you.. all the while i am on call, and spend days nursing u back 2-3 days after ur weekly &#34;stress&#34; day.. its all on me, it made me who i am ... u made me stronger and i am successful now on my own right.. you making millions of dollars yearly and not ever helping me.. making a point to ignore my struggles.. we eat out and you spent $800 on dinner.. And next day when u leave to your city, i eat in cDonalds.. how resentful i was then.. but more resentful about my ineptness to be disciplined with working.. you complaining that how are we gonna marry when i am poor, and your money will be running out.. well 11 years later i have $300.000 tax returns, i work my ass off. but its still not enough. i am sorry i don&#39;t have it in me to generate $5 million a year.. but nobody you know can do that.. anyways in the beginning it all didn&#39;t matter.. We lived like students in love, feeding on each others support and nothing was costing anything.. i always made a point not to take anything from you, felt guilty when u paid in a restaurant.. and u liked me being awkward about it.. now, years later i know you are just cheap. you found a whore that was free and you took her for a ride in your audi a8.. everything always revolved around money.. your parents had nothing.. and even they never accepted you for being gay, and never acknowledged me, they knew how to raise u a good son and make u pay for all.. them and your siblings.. you had no qualms to give your brother $80k a year for years.. but couldn&#39;t help me in a pinch.. at the end its all came out good, i had to pay back my student loans and instead of dealing with u i dealt with a bank, and paid all back within 2 years without drama.. i just sent my mom another $10.000 which i was able to do last years.. i learned how to take care of myself, and as u know i give u credit for that.. but still. u know i wanted to do more school, u know i am a valedictorian.. why not help me with my ambitions? i just couldn&#39;t get it.. i mean i know more now.. its a competition for u. your jealousy of my education, my looks, my sex.. you just had negative emotions.. and you are sociopath enough to mask them and keep me around.. same as i am addicted to your smell, and my true happiness is when i wake up in the morning and smell you.. that way you are addicted to watch me operate, do everything you despise, or secretly want.. you always praised our sex life.. i was wondering why u mention it so much, only now i know that was the nr 1 reason u chose me, not my personality.. and as i told u before, our sex was never that great.. u made me bleed every time.. and it takes u forever to cum.. don&#39;t get me wrong i loved every single time we had sex.. but only cause i love u, and i can handle pain easily. i don&#39;t think u ever will have the same, guys want to be respected and not hurt usually.. especially daily and always in the same manner.. and when u tried to be dominant with me, to give me what i want, i made u stop, it was just not believable.. always just wanted u to be who u r.. u like gentle sex, but it takes so long and its so big that it makes me bleed.. and your constant desire to be the bottom.. even that i gave u, not many guys can take my dick easy or for long.. so ur eyes were always bigger than your ass, and every-time i put it in you squealed like a pig, and thats the biggest turn off for me , to inflict pain.. of course i cant continue.. even that i am quite older than u and more experienced.. i am a bad teacher.. and its on me.. point is we had intimacy, more than anybody i ever knew.. i have never seen a couple like us.. our non verbal communication was top notch. whatever u lied, cheated, hurt me.. when i was holding you i knew the true you, and u felt the same i know.. i mean its still happening.. we are these 2 souls who are in love with each other.. but intellectually we despise each other.. and even physically we are not attracted to each other anymore.. u liked me when i looked like a Twink, skinny , awkward.. and i turned myself into a bodybuilder.. and i liked you big, your muscles.. your beautiful beautiful ass, which i was calling the golden globes.. yet, u had plastic surgery and removed your pecs, all the muscles u didn&#39;t like.. and my muscle bear is gone, replaced by an emo.. i mean of course i don&#39;t care, i am old enough by now not to care about physical appearances.. we both are beautiful to the world now, more than in the past. but we changed... i cant believe how ugly ur current boyfriend is. makes me shudder to think i looked something like him. and u keep trashing him, his intelligence, his looks, his taste, his ambitions.. you took a 22 year old semi hustler, just so u can disrespect him just as you did me.. :( i cant stand myself for being jealous still. i know i cant be with you, but i damn sure don&#39;t want you to be with someone else.. you trashing him, then sending him a message how u love him, then him hustling you for money.. i am disgusted watching this, and hate myself before all.. thats why i cant be friends with u, i just don&#39;t agree with ur conduct.. i don&#39;t want to see that. then all the traveling we did, with me planning everything out. and every trip a huge drama, cause u r petty and picky and whiny.. so i always not only have to work hard to keep the plans and schedules but also babysit you.. and then after, even now every time we meet you tell me how i organized the best trips of r life, and how amazed you are with how i make everything smooth and organized.. and how much u experienced.. well, all i remember was how hard it was to keep u happy.. and i loved doing it, i always want you to be urself, even if u r an ass.. i just wish u would quit being an ass sometimes, and to be fair u did have breaks.. i don&#39;t know.. when u were in europe for those few months.. and i missed u and i came to venice for a weekend.. 4 days of flying over holidays, to be there for 2 nights.. and ur flight was one hour.. my flight cost me $3000 which was huge money for me then.. and urs was $100.. and then u couldn&#39;t be nice and make it fun for me.. the only thing on you was to get the hotel, u offered it.. when u did&#39;nt book it timely u told me to look.. i sent u few choices, and to be fair i included a super budget hotel for $100.. All the others were like $600 a night and didnt want u to feel obliged to pay that.. you like nice places, i was sure u will either find something yourself or take one of my nice choices.. i was smiling when i saw u booked the cheapest.. i did tons of research, so even the cheapest was great.. and i ended up having my favorite window view in all of venice.. its just the room was so tiny, we had no space to move there.. and of course i just smiled, and it was on me for giving u that choice, and all i wanted was to see u.. but u spent all 2 days complaining about the tiny room, and didn&#39;t appreciate the view at all.. anyways, made me less guilty anyways.. yeah, a jolt of guilt every time you spent a cent on me.. in the beginning when u were pure u just were nice about including me in ur lifestyle when were together, even got me some gifts.. that box from nike made my year then.. i grew up so poor and monety was always such an issue, and in my family money equals love.. when u surprised me with a box of nike garments, worth maybe $250.. i was the happiest i ever was.. it was in our 2nd or 3rd month and then i knew u love me.. :) well, then i started to create the illusion of u loving me.. u just wanted to keep me compliant for sex.. but the fact that u would go chose cloths for me, think about them, and surprise me.. it was everything.. and u know how i admire ur style.. anyways back to venice.. i got complains, a kinda unhappy thanksgiving dinner in a place of your choice.. and ur obsession with 3 michelin stars restaurants is a huge waste of money sometimes.. towards the end of our relationship when u constantly complained for years that i dont make enough money and i started paying for dinners more than half of the time, and me paying it and spending hundreds $ few times weekly and u didn&#39;t even acknowledge it.. and just moved on to complaining about the next thing.. you are that father i never had, whom i could never please whatever i do.. i believed when u complained, i believed that the issue really bothered u and i would change it. and there was no feedback, a new issue arose from out of nowhere instantly.. constant blindside.. as i said it all pushed me where i am now, and its a place i couldn&#39;t fathom ever.. but still, if you have dozens of millions in ur bank, and u date a highly intelligent person, help him develop, support him to educate himself.. build him up, if its easy for u.. even if u don&#39;t think u gonna last forever, don&#39;t u think the guy will be grateful all his life to u. more than any of your family, where u spent hundreds of thousands on their universities, and they just kept dropping out and focusing on party and sex instead of the academics.. now i was fortunate that i did finish a masters degree early at an ivy league school, so it wasn&#39;t that i was uneducated.. my degree was just not in what i do professionally now.. and i wanted more foundation.. at the end being self taught gives me huge advantages now, and i am the one who educates kids after universities how to be productive in what we do.. and i get all the admiration and respect from my coworkers who graduated stanford and harward.. but few courses or degree from stanford would save me 2-3 years of self learning... to be honest i dated a few wealthy guys, too many, none as serious as you of course or as long.. none of them ever supported me, always kept my lifestyle to my means.. enjoyed the perks when i was with them of course, it was mostly older guys, i liked learning from success. i was amazed none of them wanted to help me with my educational ambitions, granted i never demanded it, or anything else ever.. but i did hint as to what i like to do.. i had a guy who was worth dozens of billions, and he was in my life for 3 years.. just hanging out whenever and wherever he wanted.. u know him, u were rude to him so we stop communicating... u didn&#39;t know him and actually asked him to stay at his penthouse in buenos aires, acting all entitled.. and i let u.. cause i loved u, and that billionaire didn&#39;t mean shit.. i was learning from him, so i kept in touch.. but this guy was an unbalanced insecure 70 year old.. i was 23, i don&#39;t know , i talk lots of shit.. so he would get upset, in the first weeks we knew each other.. and would throw a fit on the streets of paris, that i do something wrong.. who knows what.. and he would tell me, i can pay a million right now and fuck Brad Pitt in 9 hours, he would fly in here and instead i am dealing with u.. and even with 23 i was like, why don&#39;t u call him and are spending time with me.. i was perfectly fine on vacation, u asked me to fly here for few days and i came, and now u make me feel not welcome.. so after 2 weeks i knew i cant be with that guy seriously.. of course with 23 i thought the world revolves around me, and he has feelings.. and honestly that guy was so charismatic, and was so good in bed that at first i felt amazing, before i realized he cant feel secure with me.. at least he didn&#39;t let me feel guilty when he paid for dinners.. :) he was amazing.. i was just too young.. and little i knew he had boys all over the planet.. luckily i had my ambitions and quickly moved along my path, avoiding the faith of being an aged kept boy in some penthouse in south africa, rio or London.. so anyways, i would hang out with him 2-3 days every couple of months in either Paris or New York.. it got sleazy in New York once, when he left me at an event cause i he was tired and i was having fun.. and then his friend sort of came on to me.. and i was refusing, and then he told me in anger that my billionaire friend has boys like me everywhere and i don&#39;t have to play loyal, nobody expects me too.. that was a turn off, i never came out again to hang out with the guy, we stayed in touch until you were rude to him and demanded his penthouse, as if he owns u something just by proxy of liking me.. anyway.. money money money.. how u always like to say how it doesn&#39;t matter to u.. and of course u do have a different perspective, getting $5mio a year for many years starting when u r 21, its will drive u nuts.. but when i met u u were 23 and it didn&#39;t drive u nuts yet.. i was so in love with your attitude.. u didn&#39;t waste it.. u would spend $5-10k on restaurants a month and giving money to family.. food is your passion.. so i loved it, even the fact u didn&#39;t waste any on me i loved. luckily i was mature enough not to crave any chachkis anymore.. or $300 dollar polyester t-shirts with D&amp;amp;G; written on them in big letters.. many of these older guys i knew, would cover themselves in status symbols to compensate ( which i would do naturally too, and 90% of ppl ).. but u didn&#39;t give a shit, u just spent it on whats important to you, and otherwise didn&#39;t bother thinking about it.. or so i thought then.. turned out all u think about that cash, now that u retired before reaching 30.. $15mil in the bank is ok to live off interest, but u have to keep budget.. now ur head is twice as large as mine, and u were a valedictorian too.. u are finishing ur 3rd degree now.. i believe u got more to contribute to this world, and be rewarded more than before.. :) but u r surrounded by mediocracy.. all your fellow ivy league school graduates are mostly from rich families, they got $400k salaries right out of college, for little work, just knowing where to be.. and didn&#39;t acquire skills, and their lifestyles exceed their income. they all are unhappy, single. and all they want is to be u.. they think they are so smart with $15mil they could be doubling it yearly with smart investments.. i literally watched a not smart friend of yours, who was a glorified doorman in a hedge fund and raking in $500k a year beg u for chunk of your money so he can play around with it. well, he lost that job when his boss cashed out and is still looking for one 6 years later i believe.. i was surprised cause u do everything that guy says, and his opinion matters to u most. but your greed for money doesn&#39;t discriminate, just as u never invested into the company i had for a few years, watching me struggle ( while having tons of fun running it ) u don&#39;t invest in anyone.. so money on your mind.. and its not that u ever thought that i am after your money, i just did so many billion moves proving it.. but what changed, that now u became that person who disrespects regular people who work hard.. u adopted the attitude of your friends and their parents.. their parents are mostly foreigners who escaped regime changes and stole millions before they left, so they all investors who never worked.. i love working, and i am pulling 18 hour days easily when i need to get something done, i love contributing to the world in a significant way and be compensated.. and since i was brought up poor , abroad.. i am happy with having enough normally.. thats why i freelanced up until 7 years ago.. i just worked when i needed.. and spent free time on studying, getting to next level of my trade.. you couldn&#39;t stand when i am free, after 3 days you would be on my case to look for work.. of course u watched me a few times running out of money, and struggle, so u couldn&#39;t understand how i let it happen.. since i know u i worked all the time, and full time even in recent years.. but problem was u wouldn&#39;t let me save. i earned $8000 a month, and u would constantly talk about me having it and not contributing.. making me feel guilty so i would pay for the $300-400 dinners ( you were going easy on me not ordering $500 bottles of wine, just $150).. i paid utilities on your huge house ( just under $1000).. while maintaining my apartment in another city still ( for gods sake i never gave it up ).. so i felt u make me spend huge amounts of money on things i don&#39;t need... and i did it for 3-4 months.. and it didn&#39;t have any effect, u were still moody and angry and finding other things to complain.. then when i negotiated my first full time job, i got offered $100k and i was so happy.. i never made more than $85k a year freelancing.. and when i told u, u said i have to go and ask for $120k.. don&#39;t accept their offer.. i really wanted that job, i hate talking about money.. i told you no, its enough, and i am confident i will perform and get the raise i deserve.. you said you are going to leave me if i don&#39;t negotiate, in all seriousness ( prob first time when separating came up ). so i stepped all over my social conditioning, my peasant brain, my morals, my values and asked them for more money.. and i got it.. apparently you get if ask whatever u want, if they need u.. so you taught me things like that. which is good to know.. to this day though i hate negotiating, and usually my boss knows.. and every year i get maximum bonus and a raise without asking, just cause i perform highly ( compared to others around me, so it stands out ). and every time my boss would change and the new one was somebody i didn&#39;t trust in being fair i switched companies.. twice so far.. my last switch they didn&#39;t give me a raise when joining ( although i got $200k in equity ).. but after a year of being the best performer and putting my all in to it ( engineering a masterpiece ) i was curious as to how they will reward me.. and got $200k just in bonus.. not bad for the first year.. very hard demanding job as u know, but i am staying.. take that your friends who get same money by just sucking up to somebody. each cell of my brain has to stay active for over 8 hours a day to do what i do.. i am proud and happy about my work. although the stress is grueling , i don&#39;t know how long i will last.. but i put a lot of effort into my mental health and balance, so we will see.. i see myself doing it into old age.. of course now i have savings and some security.. and even can gift money to my mom.. which balances me too.. cause my parent even poor, supported me when they could.. young and reckless i would rack up credit card debt, and they took loans out to repay. where they live taxes are so high, that they only can live paycheck to paycheck. never had savings.. well my mom also splurges on chachkis, and my dad is the best specialist at a highly technical job, but they are the ones who instilled me not to negotiate and take what u r given and be grateful. well, we were immigrants to that country where they live, my dad got the job more than of couple of decades ago and they just give him tiny raises.. he is happy working there, all that counts.. but even for me, working full time it was a surprise that i have to pay 50% in taxes.. as a freelancer there were write off opportunities.. now any raises are eaten by inflation and jumping into the next highest tax bracket actually lowers ur take home salary even after a raise.. i do have enough.. and i love this country, and am happy to pay my taxes here and have the opportunities.. but i don&#39;t understand how they tax ppl with low income so much.. my dad makes $4000 a month, taxes are about 55% or so.. apartment is $1000 a month for a modest small 2 bedroom. they have 3 children, my siblings are much much younger than me. seems crazy to me that they don&#39;t give hardworking families like that room to breathe. now in that country they get free healthcare and free education, free universities. virtually no crime. unemployment is very high, but the unemployment and social benefits equal to what my hardworking father takes home.. its weird.. anyways i digress, and i digress very very very far.. this is all TMI.. this whole post.. but i been reading this section for dozen years.. and half of the posts are either what i would write, or some sound like u wrote them. we just had a fight again. since last 2 years, since u r dating this boy u went to rehab many times. u just had an overdose. why didn&#39;t it ever happen when i was there.. i nursed u through 4 last years of your difficult carrier as much as u hated it, everything was about u. your family , your friends everybody wanted that stream of income with their hands and mouths wide open. i was just there to keep u sane, and be a breath of fresh air. for years you took my energy and gave it to others. and then the violence.. didn&#39;t happen often, just 4 times in 11 years i know u.. but the nr 3 was when i left u.. in a 2 minutes decision.. packed what i could in my car and left. we didn&#39;t talk for 3-4 months.. one of your best friends, that girl was so supportive of me leaving u.. she talked to me daily when i was missing u, telling me to be strong and not contact u. i was so grateful for her.. so many good things happened at work in those months and i wanted to share them with u and resisted ( not that u would genuinely care, i know that. But i just love to share my good news with you. trying to make the daddy proud who is always not happy with me and my work and how much i make ). then turned out all that time she was working you, she had a business client who was obsessed with you, and she was matchmaking.. and u went on dates with him.. well, we made up.. became friendly.. thats when u went to school in europe for 6 months. u dated some guy, 2 u said.. i was so jealous but helpless, was focusing on my work. this girl who came between us, i obliterated.. such an unhappy creature. doesn&#39;t have a genuine bone in her body. so rotten. insanely rich parents, got best opportunities, graduated from best university. very little brain, lots of entitlement, is only advancing herself through politics.. i mean whatever floats ur boat.. But she knew me for 6 years, she knew how emotional i am about you and you about me. she always wanted to be around and you hated her.. and ur friends hated her.. u guys would talk so much shit about her. but she got u some benefits, and u got her access to some things. and i never let you be disrespectful about her in front of me, my pet peeve is when people are not honest and talk behind their back. they would even say to her face that she is an idiot and humiliate her in our circle, and she had such thick skin would always come back and suck up to then. granted she had a hard time with ppl, and they were the only close friends she knew since college. she must have been deeply lonely. so taking me, a provincial foreigner and play me like an instrument provided her entertainment. it didn&#39;t even enter my mind that i need to be protective of myself with her. i am not as naive. i lived on my own in boarding schools since i am 14, i was independent since i started walking. and with 6 i would stay out with older friends past midnight, and with 6 i knew how to navigate a 500k city. but such level of bitterness, disrespect and being sold so cheap.. back then i thought u need to be much older to achieve such a personality. well, by now i know that you discussed me the same way when i was not around. telling them i am temporary and focusing on my flaws and them eagerly helping u develop such thoughts cause i was one of the few things that was occupying your time and taking u away from them. and i didn&#39;t like any of them from the first sight. everything is a huge mind fuck, i hate how slow i am moving on. and you are not helping. happy to be free of your depression... but worried about u. i would be happy if you meet somebody who can compliment you in a good way and inspire you. somebody like me, but more selfless and closer to your social status. i just wanna be free.. free of money, guilt, worry.. i wanna date. i want to have somebody who respects me. who inspires me. i want a sophisticated partnership. i want someone fair. and someone not petty.</div>                 ')[0];

As I walked in and reached to close the door, you pulled me toward you and I was completely caught off-guard thinking you would push me to my knees to service your cock; however, you pulled me up to you and began to kiss me. It was so hot! You kissed with such intensity it felt hardly like we were strangers but more like longtime paramours finally left to consume our lust. I began to explore lower, reaching for your nipples and then lower to your cock. I serviced your cock for a while, then you pulled me up again for another kissing session. I held on to your cock as we kissed, stroking it, sliding it between my fingers. I asked if you wanted to fuck me and we lubed up for one of the hottest random fuck sessions I&#39;ve ever had. As I bent over and tried to hold on to the red door panel with one hand and press against the wall with the other, your masculine hands once again reached for my hips and this time you pulled me in toward your protruding cock. As you slipped deeper inside, me moaning &#34;fuck yeah&#34;, we pushed agains the walls and the bench and the door causing a raucous, but it didn&#39;t matter because we were both enjoying each other. You pumped me over and over and over, each time slamming me into your thick cock with your powerful hands until you couldn&#39;t hold it any more and you busted your load inside me. It turns out you are sensitive, which I found completely adorable and used this time to mess with you by clenching my muscles while your uber sensitive cock was still inside me. As payback, you quickly pulled out not allowing my muscles time to release your thick cock on its own terms. We both flinched, but it felt good. I dropped to my knees and serviced you, but your cock was really sensitive at this point so you again reached out with those strong arms and pulled me up toward you and began to kiss me once more with the same intensity as before. We were breathing heavily, we were kissing passionately; neither wanted to let go. I tried to pull away once and you pulled me back; another time I pushed you back against the wall and we went at it with such ferocity. We giggled a little as if though we were school children privy to a secret. I have not been passionately man-handled like that in a long time! The way you held me, kissed me, looked me in the eyes as it was all going down - my body quivers at the thought! I assumed I would feel dirty when I left but I left feeling exhilarated and satisfied. As I lay in bed, my fingers massaging the hole you dominated earlier, and feeling your cum still warm inside me, I cannot help but think how I would like nothing more than to do this again, either at the same place or perhaps we can do some better planing. Again, thank you man, and I hope we connect once more. Answer these so I know it is you: What kind of vehicle did you leave in? Car, Truck, or SUV What did you remove from your shirt so it would not get in the way? What kind of underwear was I wearing? Who had the lube we used? Your or me The definitive way to know it is you is by your belly button. Yours is different and I would know after looking pass it as we locked eyes while I serviced your cock. Send a pic of it and I will know it is you. *If you are DL, that&#39;s ok since I offer a discreet approach.</div>                 ')[0];

I was the asian guy who asked for detailed and descriptive information on the smoothies and their benefits; as I was completely clueless at the time. The Smoothie King where you worked (or perhaps currently working) is next to a Chik-Fil-A, across the street may be a Walmart and perhaps a Home Depot? You have a small tattoo on one of your fingers, I symbol I believe (probably mistaken, but an omega symbol?) and another on your wrist. You had lustrous strands of dark hazel brown medium length hair (tied up usually, I believe?), gorgeous glistening brown eyes, and a smile like no other. I remember we struck up small conversations when I ordered at the drive through. I&#39;m not going to lie, I really liked you. Your alluring personality, patience, and kindness had me continuing in visiting your establishment. However, most of the times I visited was, because I was stressfully studying with multiple all-nighters and may have seemed dazed sometimes. That being said, after I realized you came to the drive through just to greet me, I decided to visit in asking you out. After many failed attempts, I ended up giving up. I visited during our usual meeting hours, afternoons, weekends, and mornings, but came out fruitless. The last I saw you was about last year during April. Again, I have no idea if you&#39;re still there or ended up quitting. However, if you&#39;re reading this and are interested in meeting, I would very much like getting to know you. I hope our paths cross once again soon, Drew</div>                 ')[0];

Me: Frumpy, middle-aged fat lady against the wall, eyeing you in the mirror (possibly in a creepy way). It&#39;s okay that you didn&#39;t notice me. Hell, I wouldn&#39;t notice me. Honestly, I can&#39;t really blame you there. I am not in your league. You definitely belong to one of the higher, more desirable leagues - semi-pro or something. Okay, I&#39;m not great with sports metaphors, but your kind doesn&#39;t actually even see me. I don&#39;t even rank as an affectionate pet. I&#39;m just an ugly, outdated piece of furniture in the corner of a room otherwise filled with interesting people mingling about. But that&#39;s not the point. We were talking about you. You and your deliciousness. I just wanted you to know that I noticed it, and I did so in a way that I don&#39;t often experience. My first thoughts were actually: &#34;Buhgeezum, that man is fucking... well, not me, sadly.&#34; Yes, it&#39;s very inappropriate, but since it&#39;s a rarity for me, I enjoyed the indulgence. And I enjoyed admiring you for a moment, even though you would never see me, even if you looked right at me. If that&#39;s not the definition of a missed connection, I don&#39;t know what is.</div>                 ')[0];

I was taking my time eating my post workout meal and we made eye contact several times. You showered, changed, cleaned up and left all while I was still eating. You put on khaki shorts and a large white tee.

If you&#39;re not the guy mentioned, but are muscular and would like to meet up with another muscular man, I am black and very gl. Send pics of your upper body shirtless to get my attention.

Talked for nearly a year, a kiss every now and then, Then one day it happened, and we became much more than friends. I introduced you to my family something that never happened before, Then one day you said &#34;im leaving&#34; I just let you walk out the door. I should have fought harder and asked you not to go, I let my pride prevail, a mistake I want you to know. No calls, no texts, no letters to my home So I made the decision to move on rather than leave it to the unknown. It&#39;s probably another you met during this time, I wish you all the best and I&#39;ll be just fine. Several keep asking, how long do you need? I can&#39;t answer that, for my heart still bleeds. I hate that it ended, my best friend no more, But I would rather love &amp;amp; lost than try to keep score. I&#39;ll miss the long stares into each other&#39;s eyes, Never saying a word, now my soul just dies. The whispers, the kisses, the sensual touch, Your wit, your body I&#39;ll miss it so much.

We ran into each other first in the produce aisle, and a handful of times after that, in various parts of the store. I&#39;m sure you know, but you turned every single man&#39;s head in that store. I wanted to engage you several times, and regret not doing so, even if just to compliment your beauty. I feel I saw you look at more me more than once, I&#39;m tall so I don&#39;t know if it was just a look, or if there was curiosity behind it. I highly doubt you&#39;d see this, but if you do, I&#39;d love to grab a coffee or a drink. I didn&#39;t see any ring which is strange that a woman like you wouldn&#39;t be attached. But then again, you do give off an aura of independence and do it yourself attitude, which I can appreciate. Maybe I&#39;ll run into you again next Sunday. Give me some kind of detail to know it&#39;s you, let me know where you ended up checking out. Otherwise, I&#39;ll just put it into the universe that I saw the prettiest and sexiest mixed girl I have ever seen!</div>                 ')[0];

What I did was wrong and I want to apologize for that. It hurt me quite a bit as well on many fronts as it was a complicated situation. In fact, I really did not want to do it at all but I would have faced backlash if I didn&#39;t. I wouldn&#39;t have done it if I were faced with the situation again. I would&#39;ve taken the heat if I got another chance. I&#39;m not doing so well now and want to get this out while I can. Please understand that I am genuinely sorry, from the bottom of my heart. I am pretty sure that you read these every now and then so I hope you see this. With that being said I still think about you a lot and I&#39;m really hard on myself about losing you. You tots are a special person. There is just nobody like you. I have dated several girls since and nobody has made me feel the way that you made me feel. You may not have known at the time but I was and still am absolutely crazy about you. I didn&#39;t want to tell you that because I didn&#39;t want to scare you or anything. I think the world of you. Not only are you a beautiful person on the outside, you are beautiful on the inside too. I felt such a strong connection to you and I know you did too because the the sparks that flew could set the world on fire. I have never held anyone else or kissed anyone else for hours like we did. You are pretty, sexy, passionate, talented, fun to be around, caring and an all around great person. To be honest, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a bad time with you. I wish I could go back and do it again. Meeting you is one of the highlights of my life. I would give the world to kiss you one more time. Just thinking about it gives me chills. I wish you could&#39;ve found it in your heart to give me another chance. I could ramble on all day about you. The bottom line is that I&#39;ve never met anyone that I felt so strongly about than you and don&#39;t think I ever will. You&#39;re so special. Maybe we will cross paths again one day if I&#39;m still around. I hope so. You made life worth living. I hope I don&#39;t come off as creepy I just want to tell you how I feel while I still can. You deserve to be happy and I hope that you&#39;re doing well and that you find someone that treats you like the awesome person you are. If you see this and want to talk, please reply to this ad. I&#39;d love to talk to you. My heart is heavy for you and has been for a long time. I&#39;ll always miss you. I guess I&#39;ll never get over you. I wish I could. It&#39;s like being stuck in a hole...for years. I tried but I will not seek you out, call, text, Facebook, whatever. That&#39;s up to you. I want to show you how I feel, how it should be. Until then, hope you&#39;re doing great. I will never forget you. You&#39;re awesome! This will probably be the last time that I call out to you. If someone reading this knows her, please tip her off to this. Please don&#39;t forget me.</div>                 ')[0];

No, because I won&#39;t contact you. I decided to post here in effort to get out my most recent thoughts. Please know that I am not posting in hopes of you contacting me. I&#39;m merely venting in a place we both once frequented. I&#39;ve seen more of you in the last two weeks than i have over the last 2 years. It&#39;s brought about an array of emotions, questions, and what ifs.... more so, it brought back memories. Memories of our movielike love story and undeniable connection. Memories of your undisputed intelligence and ability to spin anything and anyone into believing what you needed or wanted. Memories of your thought out actions and the acute hold you had over anyone who crossed your path. Your words were always deliberate. Our conversations darted in all directions. There wasn&#39;t anything I couldn&#39;t or didn&#39;t want to tell you. You picked up on everything, followed my randomness, and always made me believe that i was it for you. I found these traits to be among your most attractive ones. You let me go. Looking back, I know that you probably knew you had to. By letting me go, it forced me to evaluate my own path... afterall, our relationship was never on the straight and narrow. When you left (for it happened many times) the color seemed to drain from my world. You made irrational life changing choices and I would maintain my previous life. Both of us living in what I considered love purgatory. Your absence made me miss you. I missed the smirks you gave me when I did something childish or out of the ordinary. I missed the understanding and acceptance of my complexities. I missed the smile you put on my face each time you were near. And then one day, I thought about you less. I cried less. I yearned for our future less. As months passed, I stumbled upon some harsh realities. Realities about myself. About you. About us. Seeing you brought up so many emotions, thoughts, assumptions. It forced me to wonder... do you share a love like we once had? Do you smile with your eyes as you once did? Do you regret going for stability? Do you think of me? Has the array of illy thought out decisions changed your perspective or end goal? I convinced myself I needed a goodbye in order to move on with my life. As it turns out, I didn&#39;t. I needed time and space. I needed to see myself in my own light. I needed to see us for what we were. Not what we could be. As for that hypothetical game of baseball. Well, it went into extra innings. I&#39;m on deck and the bases are loaded. This time I&#39;m going to hit that home run. Whether it&#39;s in the park or outta the park...time will tell. Whatever the hit becomes....it&#39;ll be the game ending hit. I&#39;m not sure how you feel or felt about me. At one time I was sure i knew....but like many other things time changes ones perspective. What I do know is this. What I thought we had was real. Life changing. So thank you. For all that you did. And all that you didn&#39;t do.</div>                 ')[0];

Unrequited love means un-returned love. But it does not mean that it was not real. Those who lose touch with themselves do not give their love without condition. They believe that something is owed. Look what I did for them. For me this is not love for others, rather it is love for self. Most on here are missing themselves. Nothing should ever be owed, unless you are a stalker. You gonna force yourself on the world? For those crazy enough to go hurt others I simply say look at yourself. It is you that is allowing yourself to be hurt. You are whole. You need nothing, but to find those who will give back what you give. You should know that you are loved unconditionally, regardless of anything that you do. However, many like me define their actions based on the actions others are willing to do. Get what you give. If you want more, state it to them, and give more. Not take. If you do not give enough, or get enough in return, then your connection was missed. Sadness, Anger, Jealousy, these do put an energy out there, but it is not something that will get you back what you think you want. What do I want? I want everyone to know they are loved and to share that love without condition. No, I am not talking about sex, that is another level of sharing that should be a give what you get. Anyway, you should know that you are not alone. There are many people who miss connections, and have to read and interpret their world to maximize the love they are receiving. But for me, that is not necessary. I just want to share this love, and remind you that you did get unconditional love that you may not have returned. so maybe try to be more aware of what you do have, and spend less time on what you do not have.</div>                 ')[0];

I am overweight and I get hit on all the time, and it would be easy for me to have a hookup, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m looking for. Most women aren&#39;t looking to hookup that&#39;s what guys don&#39;t understand. The men I&#39;ve been most attracted to in my life are the ones that don&#39;t hit on me right away but actually can hold a conversation. The ones that are genuine and put themselves out there and show an interest in me and what I actually have to say. Not the ones who are waiting to make their next move to get laid. Maybe women don&#39;t want to send a picture because they know what that leads to(don&#39;t want to lead anyone on) and they&#39;re not interested. You seem like you come on too strong. I posted a missed connection on here and I got bombarded with dick pics and emails asking me for pics, what I looked like and if I wanted to hookup. I was looking for a specific guy, not any random guy. It&#39;s easy for women to hookup because that&#39;s what most men want. It&#39;s harder to find a connection between someone and that&#39;s what women are looking for. Why don&#39;t you post in casual encounters instead? That is obviously what you&#39;re seeking. Women aren&#39;t trying to deceive you, you just don&#39;t understand them.</div>                 ')[0];

I&#39;m sure a lot of men on here are complete jerks and what not. Not all are bad. Yes most of us and that includes me are looking for a NSA or a FWB type of situation but the problem is when we do post something it gets bombarded by non stop fake spam messages trying to scam you. The real women are never around and the ones who are around are all BBW types. Ladies I mean absolutely no offense because I&#39;m not perfect either but a lot of guys are not into BBW type of women. We only call them BBW types because it&#39;s the politically correct way to say it. Don&#39;t get me wrong I love a woman with curves on her, but healthy curves. I even like very skinny women as well. It&#39;s all a matter of how you carry it. For me it&#39;s about are you open minded or absolutely vanilla boring when it comes to sex? If you&#39;re vanilla boring then I won&#39;t be interested. Me I&#39;m not perfect either, I&#39;m not all ripped and built and I am not going to message a woman&#39;s posting who is a perfect 10 to see if she wants to meet because those women tend to be shallow and conceited and they wouldn&#39;t be interested in me anyways. I know my limitations. So it&#39;s a constant miss and miss on here because almost nobody is real. If I offended anyone then I&#39;m sorry. I truly am. If you are real then when you post something then put something in your post that is relevant to Houston to show you are real. Make it obvious you are real because I&#39;ve noticed even the &#34;Strictly Platonic&#34; section is starting to get a lot of fake posts in it as well. Make it easier for a person to know you are real, otherwise that&#39;s why postings get flagged. If it sounds fake then it&#39;ll get flagged. And if you&#39;re not willing to put up a picture on your posting then at least describe yourself enough so the guy or girl knows or has a really good idea if they&#39;ll be attracted to you or not. One final thing, even if you&#39;re just wanting to talk via email or via text with no intention of ever meeting, people like to put a face to who they are talking too. Otherwise it&#39;s like talking to air essentially. If a guy asks you for a picture then send him a picture. I literally was talking to a woman last night from CL. She posted on the missed connections about how being single sucks. The conversation was going great and I had zero intentions on ever trying to meet her. It was just a nice conversation. I said to her &#34;Can I see a picture to you so I can put a face to the nice woman that I&#39;m speaking with&#34;? and from that moment on she flipped out on me and it got ugly fast. Ladies if you refuse to send a picture it&#39;s not the end of the world but every single time that has happened in my life which is about ten or fifteen times the woman I was talking too was hiding something and it was she looked nothing like she described, she was really overweight and trying to hide it, or it was a dude pretending to be a woman. People in general are not stupid and they catch on quickly to people trying to play games or not being honest. Just be honest and don&#39;t play games and life will be so much easier and more simple.</div>                 ')[0];

Apparently you have a hard time making friends. I just want a lover. I definitely have a hard time finding lovers. However, you seem to have the best of all worlds. And it&#39;s all my fault because I&#39;m such a pussy. But it really doesn&#39;t matter what I do or say anymore. Nothing I do or say will ever seem to change your mind. So I can admit without shame that I am in love with you. I certainly don&#39;t fear being rejected by you because you&#39;ve already done it multiple times. What I don&#39;t understand is why you consider me such a good friend, when I&#39;ve made it clear that I can never truly be a friend to you, at least not the friend that you seek. But what does it matter. I have been so tragically in love with you for the last 5 years, I&#39;m pretty sure that I will continue to allow you to take advantage of that. So you will forever continue to torture me, whether you remain in my life or not. Most likely, you will remain in my life, because I can&#39;t bear the thought of never being with you again. And you can&#39;t bear the thought either. The only difference is that I can give you everything you want from me, while your &#34;current&#34; fiance provides you with the rest. Meanwhile, your fiance will never make you happy; as was the case with every man I&#39;ve ever seen you with. But at least they can make your pussy wet, something I apparently can&#39;t do. So no matter how painful it is for me to accept reality, I can&#39;t seem to shake you because you keep coming back to me for things that your man can&#39;t seem to give you. And of course, you will never be able to provide me with the one thing that I want more than anything: your love. And to be quite honest, I don&#39;t even think you care. I wish that I didn&#39;t love you. I wish that I could forget about you forever. I wish that you could understand that we are both taking advantage of one another. And I wish that you could realize that you are taking advantage of me far more than I am taking advantage of you. And if you have a hard time understanding that, then simply remember this. I am taking advantage of you every time I allow you back into my life because I long for your company, however painful it is to me. And you are taking advantage of me every moment you spend with me right before you return home to your lover with wet panties. And if you don&#39;t understand that, perhaps you are not as good a friend to me as you think you are.</div>                 ')[0];

After some time, the messaging stopped, or should I say, I stopped responding to your texts. What you always feared had indeed happened...I met an amazing woman and her and I started dating. Flash forward to over 6 months later and I couldn&#39;t be happier. She is an amazing woman in so many ways and really is a &#39;good one&#39; I was looking for.

Hopefully this will intrigue you in wanting to connect with someone whom you may want to get to know, and do things with on a respectful level. I have been single for almost a year and at my age of 37 I have come to realize that my focus on being a Watchman for God and doing His Will is sufficient enough if I am meant to be single. I am just tired of giving my all in a relationship to get to far and realize that one of us is not on the same boat, page, goals, etc ... of that relationship. Therefore, I rather be me with no more stresses of a relationship to only be single. So, if anyone would love to make a connection, at least by way of interests and hobbies, then here I am. I want someone, a friend or group of friends, whom make plans to go hiking, fishing, camping, go see a movie at the outdoor movie &#34;Show Boat&#34; past Cypress, go see a live sporting event, go hangout at breweries while having great talks, go to festivals around Texas and so on, and so on. Basically, I am hoping to enjoy life with great company. It needs to be focused around interests and hobbies, because we should all respect each others beliefs by wanting to learn, and understand, if they are different than others. These types of differences should enhance the times of hanging out as it opens up passionate dialogue amongst friends where sharing such beliefs open up others to the makeup of each persons past, to the present. I will say that I am A MAN OF GOD and do my best to be a Watchman for him and lightbearer. On another note, I am not one to conform to society. Meaning, if you are one that believes everything the government tells you, public schools taught you, in love with the brainwashing hollywood, mass media or social media then you are about to be introduced to a rabbit hole of fact checking, AND TRUTHS with this guy. I once was of this dark world in my younger days but when my life changed with a purpose I began to question EVERYTHING to only find the proofs that this world is run by some elitists whom lie about everything. ** can explain this in the future **wink** Forrrrrrrrr meow, I really hope to find someone whom I can have great times and memories with. Whom is ready to begin making them? Mark</div>                 ')[0];

Howdy and may you enjoy reading this long posting on this dumb website. Hopefully this will intrigue you in wanting to connect with someone whom you may want to get to know, and do things with on a respectful level. I have been single for almost a year and at my age of 37 I have come to realize that my focus on being a Watchman for God and doing His Will is sufficient enough if I am meant to be single. I am just tired of giving my all in a relationship to get to far and realize that one of us is not on the same boat, page, goals, etc ... of that relationship. Therefore, I rather be me with no more stresses of a relationship to only be single. So, if anyone would love to make a connection, at least by way of interests and hobbies, then here I am. I want someone, a friend or group of friends, whom make plans to go hiking, fishing, camping, go see a movie at the outdoor movie &#34;Show Boat&#34; past Cypress, go see a live sporting event, go hangout at breweries while having great talks, go to festivals around Texas and so on, and so on. Basically, I am hoping to enjoy life with great company. It needs to be focused around interests and hobbies, because we should all respect each others beliefs by wanting to learn, and understand, if they are different than others. These types of differences should enhance the times of hanging out as it opens up passionate dialogue amongst friends where sharing such beliefs open up others to the makeup of each persons past, to the present. I will say that I am A MAN OF GOD and do my best to be a Watchman for him and lightbearer. On another note, I am not one to conform to society. Meaning, if you are one that believes everything the government tells you, public schools taught you, in love with the brainwashing hollywood, mass media or social media then you are about to be introduced to a rabbit hole of fact checking, AND TRUTHS with this guy. I once was of this dark world in my younger days but when my life changed with a purpose I began to question EVERYTHING to only find the proofs that this world is run by some elitists whom lie about everything. ** can explain this in the future **wink** Forrrrrrrrr meow, I really hope to find someone whom I can have great times and memories with. Whom is ready to begin making them? Mark</div>                 ')[0];
