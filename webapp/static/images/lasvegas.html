My friends knew the choices I made when it came to being with you, and one even came to hang out with us Thursday night. You had to hide the fact that you were with me. Then you took cheap shots on facebook. Really why because you hate me that much? You want me to not post my ads and flag them. Yet you post your own and that&#39;s ok from your perspective. You want me to show you some commitment so I got this place for the night to hang out enjoy and all you want to talk to do is talk about your Clients. Not exactly a topic I would like to hear. Our next date was to go get to the documents to that are needed for you to quit this line of work but I&#39;m starting to feel like you love it and that you&#39;re only messing around with me because I&#39;m in easy meal ticket. So please make a choice and stand by it, either say goodbye and leave me alone quit messing with whatever I am doing and you will never hear from me sgain.. Or you need to get all in and show me something as well. Where have you shown commitment to me. Concern for our life. You keep saying this is your home but you treat it like atrash dump. Not cool. So here it is. The only time you can say what you want do. Cause you wounded me good, so you had best be sure this time. I probably won&#39;t be there next time</div>                 ')[0];

There were no expectations of payback, of &#34;compensation&#34;. I insisted upon nothing that would force choices you weren&#39;t prepared to make. You were out of the frying pan, and I did not prepare a fire. I only gave you a place to rest, and the knowledge and resources to heal yourself. And, surprisingly, you were able to do so, within mere weeks. You wanted to be away from the minute-to-minute life, not knowing where you&#39;d be, a week from the &#34;now&#34;. I provided a basic plan and for your basic needs, and then some. I remained open to how you wanted to proceed, and offered opportunities to advance yourself, again, without expectation, and willing to support a path of your choosing. And I was straight-up about it. No equivocation, no hesitation, no requirement that the straight life would require the elimination of fun, of recreation, of those things that likely contributed to some of your troubles. (As it would turn out, even that wasn&#39;t enough, for you.) And so, with what (apparently) began as a chance encounter, and growing friendship, a few months later, having spent so much time together, exclusively, 24/7 with nary an exception, we would speak, in jest and comfort, of how visits with the grandchildren would go. Were you merely indulging what you believed was my dream? I&#39;d never brought up the subject, but yes, that is what I wanted, with you, and what I still want, whether or not it&#39;s with you. Fast forward to a month ago, and may G-d forgive me for any resentment that I hold, if I can make no sense of what I imagine, and know to be true of, how you are spending your time, right now, in what kind of place, where and with only the devil&#39;s rejects know whom. You have made it impossible for me to make contact with you, having given away or sold the phone given you and you have told me you&#39;ve done so, deliberately, leaving me with &#34;no way to contact you&#34;, but also with injuries from which I&#39;ve yet to recover, legal predicaments, all manner of expenses, and heavy obligations you had convinced me to take on. Each minute, each hour, each passing day makes me sad for what has been lost. and the growing, and certain, distance betwen us, not of space, but in spiritual essence. Perhaps it was never there, and you have played a very cruel trick, to punish me ..... for I don&#39;t know what, yet. One couldn&#39;t even begin to speculate about the kinds of wrongs that must be done to deserve this. But I did not lose that dream, and I still have fire for it. I do not question my choices, in life, nor my conscience. I have weakness, as all others do, but I do not go so far as to accept all that has come at me, and all that will come my way, as justified by any one, or all, of those choices. As for that dream, with you, it plays tricks on my mind, to read the posts of ghost turds on this site, to think that it&#39;s actually you. Can&#39;t do that. I already have lost too much to afford continuing that delusion. You&#39;d have known how to tell me that, personally. You have no sympathy for the actual physical and spiritual pain I continue to endure, and the conditions I suffer under, which your presence in my life, could make better, to assuage the anxiety, to ameliorate existing harms, to some degree. Even if you had zero interest in a future, with grandchildren, with me, I still would&#39;ve hoped that, for any one of those things (and there were many) I&#39;ve done for you and on your behalf, you&#39;d feel some small degree of obligation, likewise, to me. I never abandoned you in your time of need. But I supppose, at the least, I&#39;d deserve a voicemail message telling me that you&#39;re going to &#34;move on with your life&#34;, and that I should just &#34;move on with mine&#34;. Wow.</div>                 ')[0];

I was standing under a tree resting when I noticed her trying to carry one of her dogs that looked to weigh almost as much as her. Being a dog lover I asked her what was wrong. Her larger dog, a retriever named Trinity, had cut her paw pads and was bleeding. I happened to have a first aid kit and did my best to wrap her paws. I offered to help carry the dog back to the car and during the hike back we got to know each other a little more. I haven&#39;t lived in Vegas long but so far its been difficult meeting genuine people that have similar interest with me. When we got to the parking lot we exchanged names but I never asked for her phone number. I didn&#39;t want her to think I helped her just for that reason and I thought that one day we might bump into one another again. So months later and it hasn&#39;t happened. If anyone reading this knows a girl by the name of Ashley that has two dogs, one of them a retriever named Trinity, please let her know I&#39;m looking for her. I don&#39;t know if shes seeing anyone and even if she is I would a the very least like to have a friendship with her. Thanks for taking the time to read this.</div>                 ')[0];

You were coming out of Walmart!!:  	Wow you were coming out of Walmart tonight and i looked at you and you kind of gave me a smile. I was so stun I didn&#39;t know what to do so I kind of smiled back. You had on a blue top with some black shorts with a cute little fellow with you that looked like your son. All I can say is I bet you have someone or had someone who truly did not know how to treat you. Im sure he don&#39;t realize what a sweet person you are. I can look at you and tell and I know that sweet ones always end with the losers who don&#39;t respect them and treat them like crap!! Smh Well to that all I will say is don&#39;t be stupid like most females who spend their entire lives chasing behind cute guys who dont do anything but cheat on them and treat them like dirt. Don&#39;t be stupid like the rest of the females and think the only thing that matters in life is finding a guy that is cute and the they he treats her doesn&#39;t matter as long as he is cute!! If you do, you will go years like most stupid females jumping from cute guy to cute guy and getting your heart broken over and over again for the rest of your life!! Break that dumb stupid spell and don&#39;t be like those stupid girl friends of yours who worry about getting cute guys to impress their friends with and all that ends up happening is him sleeping with all of them! Be smart and let a good man like myself love, respect and treat you and your son like nothing in the world matters but you and him and making you both the happiest mother and son on the planet! I know you may think Im joking but all i asked is you give me a chance to prove if and we can go a year or longer if you wish not ever touching each other!! See real man who really care and love a female is not concen about getting her in bed as fast as he can and most females don&#39;t understand that!! They think that sleeping with a guy fast will get him to like them more and that is not the case and most females are too stupid to ever get that though their heads so they sleep with a guy fast thinking well if i don&#39;t another girl will and they lose every single time!! See falling in love and being in love is not all about sex!! You cannot live in the bed, and most people are too stupid to figure that out so they have nothing in common when they get out of the bed and the relationship eventually fails!! See love is about getting to know that persons ins and outs, what they like and what they don&#39;t like. What makes them happy and what does not. Knowing that communication is the key to any long lasting relationship!! You must talk and be COMPLETELY HONEST with each other about every single thing and I mean EVERY SINGLE THING! Because keeping secrets and I don&#39;t care how small they are will only bring disaster!! With social media everyone is looking for the greener grass and no one is getting it!! Everyone is cheating and disrespecting each other thinking that they can easily find someone else online and most find out that that online dating is the worst type of dating you can do!! Nothing but a bunch of fake people acting like their someone else!! So I say to you, if you are reading this and you know who I am please respond and let me show you what kind of man that I am and how i can make you and your son two of the happiest people on this planet!! I&#39;m not psycho or crazy and if you just give me a chance to prove to you everything I am saying here you will see that I&#39;m not also!! I am very honest, and I don&#39;t steal, lie, drink or smoke!! And I have never cheated in any of my previous relationship, and I have not ever raised my hand to any female!! Ever!! And I don&#39;t do drama....NONE!!! Thanks for reading this.</div>                 ')[0];

That and the fact that I did not want to ruin anything we had built up. I just wanted us to be everything good without the difficulties of games and bullshit always I know now, that the second we met, I was yours. I just did not know it then. I did not know that the reason I remained so loyal to staying involved with you was because I did not want to be without you. I love everything about you and everything about us. I hate being apart from you but, in a sense, it has made me know exactly what I need and want in my life moving forward. I do not think we are promised &#34;another life&#34; or a tomorrow even. What we do have is a RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! I know we suck the life out of each other and it is hard to function after 24 hours of being together. I know what &#34;fuck your brains out&#34; means now. I am willing to live the rest of my days brainless and unable to function. This is a chance that i want to take because I think without the fear we will be so much stronger. Fear is what paralyzes. Lets replace it with love, hope, concern, compassion, strength, and lets replace it with courage to reach for a better, higher place together ( I kind of sound like Hillary Clinton right now but i am not intending to and please people do not send me any hate mail ) You are the strongest most disciplined man that I have ever known next to my dad. YOU ARE SUPERMAN You are already a little crazy and I still call you my superman and i will always be there to hold your hand and be your friend in the end all you have to do is keep me by your side ( from a political speech to a rock star...see how much talent i have ) I do not ever want to have fear control me or my actions. I learned that through you and it is by far one of the biggest most important lessons i have learned to date. I want to feel safe and if I am afraid to work through it like a normal human. .I get it. I know that you asked and you tried. It made me the happiest girl on the planet. If you ever know anything know that . You make me walk on sunshine. I did not want to ever ruin that. I should have realized than that we both need to walk on sunshine. leaving did not allow that Its late.....but never too late when you have hope.

The place I met you, and lost my heart. To think, the child we could of had would be going to college this year. It breaks my heart to know where we are now, vs. back then. What and why it happened, still is a mystery to me in parts. I know you had to leave, to do your job. The silence is what killed me. You never knew what you left behind, never knew what became of me. I am not going to give you that pleasure of knowing without you showing me you want to. You always said that I was stronger than I gave myself credit for. You were right on so many levels and wrong on so many more. So much so, I would love to clear the air, but I cannot do it alone. For the love of god and all that is holy, it hurts like hell that you don&#39;t want to know. Ten years, I loved what? Ten years, I searched for what? To find what? I am a fool, you showed me this. I may have given up, because it is what you wanted from me. You told me how foolish it was to try to make it work. You told me it would never be. You gave up on us before I ever did. Don&#39;t you DARE blame me for doing what you said. You are the first one that moved on. You cheated. You lied to me, you hurt me first. I only gave you your heart and told you to go back to her and let her be yours if you needed it. You never returned. I knew two months after you left, I didn&#39;t need any more time for you to think. You had your answers the very week you came to her and you and I BOTH damn well know it. To think, this would have been our tenth year together, married, had you given me a damn week. I was asking for a week, faith, and reassurance that you trusted me. What did you do? Your drunk ass decided that I didn&#39;t want you and that my surprise wasn&#39;t worth your time. You screamed at me and said you needed to get this done. I let you go, and never looked back. You accused me of holding you back. Well, children do that to you. I already had one. 6 months after you left, this time of year, I had another that you know nothing about. I wish you did, GODS do I wish you knew. Your stubborn and block headed ass doesn&#39;t want to. In Ten years, I have been in the same place. I never left. I never went to my ex wife. You just wanted an out and I gave you it with her. You wanted to leave, I could tell. You didn&#39;t want the baby. I knew that too when you screamed you didn&#39;t want me to raise yours. Irony is the spice of life, here I am, raising one without you. -sighs- Where do we go from here? It doesn&#39;t take rocket science, or a library of books to figure out what I am saying. I can&#39;t get over you if your image is the very one that kisses me good morning and good night. He is your mini you in every way and it kills me that I heard you could have died this time of year. I know you were going into the military and you told me to look here. &#34;We will always have Vegas,&#34; You said. Yea, you will. I never made it back. My first child&#39;s father tried to kill me and everyone around me and I tried to save you. What a waste of myself. I spent ten years trying to find the answers. A year I searched hardest. This is the decade anniversary of me saying that you wanted to disappear, because you are a ghost. Now, I am trapped in love with a damn ghost and can&#39;t move on or have any real relationship. Thanks. Even in death you won&#39;t let me see the truth of what love is. If this is it, it hurts too. I would rather be used like Kleenex than be given the silence to comfort me to sleep with tears. Ten years my heart is bare and torn raw and I would rather have been used so I COULD get over it. This hurts worse, this is dying while alive, suffocating while breathing and existing with no feeling. I am dead inside. I am a living dead girl and there is only one that can or could fix it. He is so far gone from me, he is so stubborn, but yes. &#34;We will always have Vegas.&#34; The convention I went to and found you kissing her and rubbing her belly. The convention I was at with my daughter and our son to surprise you. Yes, I was there, I was the &#34;Special Guest&#34; you were supposed to have that never showed. Showed I did, saw I did, and left I did. My family was all there, watching and laughing. Blissfully unaware. I ran from it, and the pain and you and all of it. I stuck my head in the sand. If you still care, know I am still by the bridge near the thumb of the bay. You know, my hometown. Right where you left me. This year, I have to work at a drugstore as a cashier instead of there. Good luck to you. I am so very proud of you to see your work and all we did go so far. Taking the credit wasn&#39;t hard for you. Now, I am the ghost. You ensured that when you made me sign. I am happy for you, the company and all our friends not knowing what was taken from me. I would NEVER embarrass you like this in public, hence here. NO, this isn&#39;t a rant. It is a missing Connection. The missing connection with the truth and the trust in myself once again. At one point in time the trust was all in one man, and now he is just a memory. How sad is love?</div>                 ')[0];

I was sitting at the bar when you came up and asked the bartender to make something strong and quick. After a minute of you not deciding I suggested a drink for you which you went with, I had the same one. Conversation started with you and the bartender with me joining in afterwards. Then we began to talk and you opened up about yourself. We were on the same flight which got delayed, more time for us to talk ;) You showed me Instagram pics of yourself that I didn&#39;t believe was even you. We both left the bar at the same time and you said, &#34;I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m waiting for you&#34; haha. We boarded and I was on before you. You said hey as you walked by but I was half asleep/drunk but I said hey once I realized. Once we landed I waited for you but ran into a friend and got distracted. You must have slipped by because I never saw you again... Highly doubt you&#39;ll ever see this but I just wanted to say you are beautiful, have such an amazing smile and really great eyes. If you do see this, email me with the drink you ordered and the city we were flying to. Would love to talk to you again.</div>                 ')[0];

After looking for you for 1 1/2 years, I ended my search; but I carried a letter of &#34;Apology and Explanation&#34; should I see you by chance. Now after 2 years, I must close this unfortunate chapter in my life, and move forward. To bring some sense of closure, I have posted the content of that letter. And although the odds that you will see this are slim to none...one can never know. Besides, the intent of this is for me to find closure...a way to say goodbye; and when this post is pushed off Craigslist...it will truly be over... thirty-one December twenty fifteen To Mystery Girl...seven, and thirty July twenty fourteen; eight October twenty fifteen It was on July seventh, and thirtieth, twenty fourteen that we met... briefly. Because of a nostalgic feeling, I was drawn to you. Also, my looking younger than my age apparently added confusion to this situation. I really liked you...but because of a perceived big age difference, I knew I could not have you. Being confused and conflicted, I could not find the words to tell you that I was too old for you; and I subconsciously walked away without saying anything...which I deeply regret. And although I did it subconsciously, it was still a horrible thing to do. On those two days you showed two different looks. When I saw you on July thirty, twenty fourteen, I did not recognize you. You looked different than you did on July seven, twenty fourteen. But I knew you were the same person because of the light black jacket with silver buttons you wore on both days. I tried to remember how you looked that day. So when I saw you on October eight, twenty fifteen in Albertsons, I was not sure it was you. I stared right at you, and I could not recognize you. It wasn&#39;t until a day later I realized that the way you looked in Albertsons was similar to to how you looked on July seven, twenty fourteen. I know that &#34;MAKE UP&#34; can change a persons looks. I missed the chance to talk with you...to apologize to you. Its now been seventeen months that I have been looking for you. It felt awkward for me to be searching for someone whom I perceived to be about half my age...short of being the proverbial &#34;dirty old man&#34;. But, I don&#39;t know how old you really are. I kept looking because I cared. As time goes on, you may be getting older...but for me, I&#39;m just getting old. Because of my inability to readily recognize you and the passage of time, not being able to find you has proven to be difficult...It is time for me to move on with my life. Although you are a stranger to me, you had endeared yourself to me because of the action(s) I perceived you have done. To walk away from someone I could potentially love...IN ANY CAPACITY, was a difficult thing to do. Seeing you brought back a nostalgic feeling I have not felt in years made me really like you. Your action(s) thereafter...made me love you. You will never know how important you meant to me. Although my search has ended, it is my hope that by chance I&#39;d find you. To express to you how truly sorry I am for the pain and hurt I caused you. To explain to you what transpired; so you would know why it happened. To do so would give me closure. I wish I could have found the words to tell you on that fateful day...July thirty, twenty fourteen. We could have been friends. With much respect; Aloha...AJV PS: Others have asked the question as to why did I search for someone for so long that I knew I could not be with? I believe that she did not just happen to be in Walmart on July 30; I believed that this girl for more than 3 weeks waited around McDonalds. When I walked in, I always pass McDonalds, and stay to the right. When I reached the Meat Department, she walked in front of my cart; glanced at the meat display on the shelves, turned towards me...smiled; came around on my left, and stood on my right. Just before I blanked out (subconsciously walked away)...when I did not say anything...there was a look of shock on her face; that is what hurt me the most. She had endeared herself to me...IN ANY CAPACITY...unofficial daughter; 25% beneficiary to my estate. I felt that if I could not love her as a girlfriend, I would love her as a daughter. I searched for 1 1/2 years before giving up...and now, the person that I find as a companion has to come first; more so now since I just been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. This post is my closure...It is time for me to move on...</div>                 ')[0];

Months ago we both have said that to each other in my work-place and we now call each other &#34;HONEY&#34;......do you remember that? You are a nice and friendly customer and you sometime come in the Deli where I work, taking your espresso-coffee. I think and hope we have understood &#34;something&#34; about each other, we have such a kind of connection (though I&#39;m not sure 100%). If I am right, reply to this ad with the information you have about me and tell me something about you, I (we) cannot do it over there, it&#39;s a (my) work-place! We also make a lot of compliments and we often hug to each other. Few months ago, twice, I&#39;ve touched and squeezed a little bit your biceps muscle of your left arm and I&#39;m sure you liked that because you contracted that to let me feel it...entirely! You said, &#34;I&#39;m going to the gym&#34;. I&#39;d like and want to see the rest of the muscled body you have, naked...even better! Sunday July 3rd when I brought you your espresso (and then a strawberry) and we were alone in the big room, almost stammering, I was attempting to ask you to give me a nice and tight hug and you understood very fast and before I could finish the phrase you immediately did it, squeezing me a little...it was sooo cool, I really felt your body against mine and honestly I&#39;d like to feel more &#34;of you&#34;! Last weekend (July 15, 16 and 17th) you came three days in row and as usual I brought you the espresso, some liqueur-like-cherries and I gave you a little rubber-duck as a gift, you said &#34;I&#39;ll keep this duck in my truck&#34; and we&#39;ve talked about body-hair. You also came Saturday (you asked me for a hug) and Sunday (I asked you for a squeezing hug and you did) July 23-24th and today Thursday July 28th in a different hours than usual. Today with that light-green t-shirt you were more than handsome, you were very cool! Sorry if I couldn&#39;t help you but as you&#39;ve seen I was busy but I found the way to hug you for a second. If I am wrong, forget about all of this, never mind and sorry! I misunderstood then, if so, please forgive me! You know, I come from the same European country like the maternal side of your family and not being American, my English is still suck. No love and / or sentiments are involved in this but I&#39;d just like to have some very private time with you...with M2M fun in the bed as well (in the bed I am totally versatile, 100%, so you can decide what to do, I&#39;d be completely yours! LOL). All of this in absolute discretion (NO ONE MUST to know, nobody needs, just us! Even because once, long time ago, you told me you have a girl-friend, so the discretion would be mandatory). No diseases (ANY, tested last July 11th 2016 and I can prove it with test-results), very clean and no drugs here. I live alone (less than 2 Miles from the work-place) so you could come over, with no problems. You&#39;d be more than welcome, we could have a drink or two, I get several different things to drink, alcoholics, wine, beer, coffee from my country and simple sodas and juices. We also could have a conversation, watch TV, surf the Internet or whatever you want and / or like! If you see this and are interested, let me know, reply typing &#34;Honey in the Deli&#34; to avoid scam, spam and shit like that...or simply call or text me, you have my number! I&#39;d really like to spend pleasant time with you. I repeat, no love and / or sentiments are involved, it&#39;s just physical attraction...that&#39;s it! You know, always Mondays and Tuesdays are my days off as I know yours are Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Feel free to ask me whatever (else) you need to know. Peace and Love, I hope to hear from you...&#34;Honey&#34;. Sometimes the dreams come true and I&#39;m crossing my fingers! LOL.</div>                 ')[0];

It usually ends with fuck you, or I hate you that would be the norm, that I am used too. You say, you need time to heal, and I get that. Sometimes yes my selfish needs get the best of me. But the thing that I know, is its not the healing you need. Because if it was you wouldn&#39;t be over here like you just were. I can see that in your eyes, your tryimg to lead with your brain, but instead want too run off with your heart. I love our time together, and yes only if it is for a moment. I know your terrified of coming out my front door, because everyone over here knows who you are. I love how we laugh at the guys responding too your post promising you the world if only they knew they were number 459 for the day. Lol I didn&#39;t realize there were so many rich, intellegent single available men in las vegas, funny how everyone of them claim to be important. Chuckles.. anyways you know how I feel for you christina, it&#39;s not a secret and if you don&#39;t end up with me you deserve too be happy not with someone who will throw you away everytime another butterfly flaps their wings. You are a special warm-hearted amazing person with the world&#39;s potential resting on your shoulders. I thought I knew what love was, but then I met you. It&#39;s and amazing feeling. Your cuddles and warm body will live on in my mind for eternity. Pete, P.s. the rest of the world can fuck off</div>                 ')[0];

I am 100% Positive what i meant I need time to be me again. This does not mean be depressed or unhappy. This means I cant jump into another relationship right now. I am trying to break the pattern of needing someone when I truely dont. Relationships are toxic to me they always get the best of me, leaving me. you are ahead of the game with 2 handsom young boys by your side. Any girl would be a fucking fool not to love you unconditionally. I dont want you on the sidelines, I dont want a friend with benefits, I want to spend my life with someone who is worthy of it. I would be selfish to give you my heart now when its filled with my ex. I have to heal, I dont play games or lead anyone on, I am not a heart breaker or Player. Im a traditional lady that believes in 1950 values. Today, you will never see that but thats how I was raised. I know your terrified to let me go. You must gain confidence that one day, I will be healed and come to you whole hearted. ~ c</div>                 ')[0];

If you believe you are him please respond with proof. Such as, where you are originally from. OR, if you have an old pic. We lost contact around &#39;91 so an old pic would help so I could identify you. Again, I am NOT trying to cause any problems. Just trying to find an old friend. I&#39;m asking for so much in the way of proof because I have already spent hours talking to people who insist they&#39;re him or KNOW him and it&#39;s all been a lie.

I wonder if it is that you have grown so much and realized how great of a guy you really are. The reality that I saw from second one has set in finally. With that confidence, you have taken your world to a new level. One that you did not want to share with me. Maybe I do not belong at that level because I loved the naughty but nice that you brought to the game. A combination of pure and evil that created fire that never burnt out For me, the innocent and deviant in you brought on the perfect storm. I am a passionate person by nature but feel like a robot now. I go through the motions but I feel nothing. Its like I am not there. NO !! Its like you are not there !! I want to feel like i can not keep my hands to myself, like i have to follow you from room to room just to be by your side, I want to feel like i am burning up inside, so hot that you can not touch me, I want to not be able to walk, but want more and more..... Am I a junkie who is hooked on desire and can not get a fix? Was what we had a once in a life time experience?</div>                 ')[0];

We were having a friendly chat about the various Pokemon nearby with the cashier. You brought up a Nine-tails that got away the other night. I had a 10 pound bag of ice rapidly returning to its liquid state, so I had to leave before I could really start throwing out all my pokemon-themed pickup lines like Pokeballs. Ok, I&#39;ve only got one...maybe two...dozen. Without sounding too creepy, I&#39;d love to meet up with you some night at the park to see if we can catch something rare. If you&#39;re single and interested in getting to know the handsome somewhat overweight guy that was failing miserably at flirting with you, get in touch. Tell me what Pokemon you were catching when I interrupted your game so I know you&#39;re the right person.</div>                 ')[0];

We were on an American Airlines flight from Las Vegas/Chicago connecting to Baltimore this morning... You were in the window seat, I was in the aisle. I wish I would have boarded earlier so I could&#39;ve sat closer to you... I tried to muster up the courage to say something but I couldn&#39;t make the words come out. What does a guy like me say to a woman like you? I couldn&#39;t bring myself to follow you off the plane, I didn&#39;t want to bother you.. You: you had a small black backpack and small suitcase. I got a glimpse of your luggage tag- your name starts with an S... You wrote it in cursive so it was hard to read.. Sarah? Samantha? Serena? You were tiny yet curvy in all the right places (maybe 120#?), about 5&#39;5&#34; ish, with long cascading chocolate curls, in your early to mid 20&#39;s, clearly either on a business trip since nobody flys from LAS to BWI alone besides us, and you clearly dress to kill in all black tight pants, fitted t shirt with knee-high riding boots and a form fitting red leather jacket... Good god. Me: slender, tall (6&#39;3&#34;), classic yet trendy pompadour hairstyle with a rugged beard (sorry, it was early), mid 30&#39;s, wearing a Ravens shirt under a black leather jacket with black jeans, had my Mac with me while I was unsuccessfully trying to look busy and not stare at you the whole flight. S: if I never see you again I just want to say: You are so profoundly beautiful... Yet quiet and unassuming, so I&#39;m guessing you have no idea how truly stunning you are. While you were listening to music with your headphones in (good taste by the way), I watcheD you and noticed how many eyes following you (mostly men) as they found their seats... and you had no clue at all. You deserve to be happier and I think I could make you happy. You looked so poetically sad looking out that window. I wish I could&#39;ve seen what you were seeing out there. Something about you made me want to weep in your presence and call you mine so you&#39;d never have to be alone again. I don&#39;t know if you have a boyfriend or a husband (didn&#39;t see a ring) so if you do, I&#39;m sorry. He isn&#39;t treating you right. If he was he&#39;d be with you every second of every day, as he should. If you gave me the chance (I know, the odds are against me) I would treat you better than you&#39;ve ever known. If you by any chance remember me and are interested in seeing where we could go, please reply and let me know what row we sat in. I promise I&#39;m not crazy... This has never happened before and I&#39;m not sure what is compelling me to write here. S, you left an impression on me and the fact that I didn&#39;t let you know right then and there is killing me.</div>                 ')[0];

Ultimately, wasn&#39;t what you actually did, and will continue to do, or the fact that you have no interest in expanding your mind, your horizons, or your skillset ..... It was how exceptional you are at lying about it, with that mouth, just to get more of the same. And how the unwary folks who help you will be destined to be treated worse than every other scumbag around you. Obviously, I have sympathy for those men who are unwary and who believe they can wade deep with girls like you and, let&#39;s say, try to put a life-jacket on ya, or teach you to swim. But you want to be out there, and stand on their shoulders, and nothing more, till they need to come up for air, and then you kick them in the head, they drown, and you go back to lure another in, with your cries for help. I say girl, because you&#39;ll continue to convince yourself that you&#39;re in control of that process, and take pride in it, not recognizing what actually is driving you-the addiction, the resentment of those who either do not partake or are not controlled by it, and the hostility you carry against all those whom you consider judgmental, particularly those dumb enough not to recognize that there are many people in the world who, without fail, will develop resentment of those who help them. I still hope you get the meds you need, and then eventually wean yourself off of them. You&#39;re already half down the road to dementia, with one psychotic-break a month. You lose a week to 10 days every month, sleeping, or itching to fight those you claim to love. Add to that your daily coffee and sugar requirements, the malevolent jesters you insist on surounding yourself with, all of that relentness doing of nothing constructive, and eventually, because of your surroundings, the fact that you&#39;re bound to hit that point where the forehead fuck-crease is permanent .... yikes. I don&#39;t wish you any bad that you haven&#39;t already invited, if not entreated, to enter your life, but I haven&#39;t any sympathy left. You&#39;ve treated me in such a cold heartless, inconsiderate, and irresponsible way, and, thankfully, I have enough love for myself to resist further contact or extend a hand, though I&#39;d tried, and I felt both shame and embarrassment. I&#39;d say good luck, but it&#39;s only between you and G_d who much you&#39;ve squandered, already. (And your friends, whom you claimed so strongly that you did not to have, to the point of vicious argument - keep &#39;em away from me, please.

I never claimed to be nor did I think that you would be making me whole. What I did think is that we had a chance to do something fabulous together. To reach for a higher tomorrow. To have fun and to laugh at things together. I thought we had a good connection that would could make better. I was hurt and felt very insecure and i could not get you to talk to me so I desperately grasped at straws and said things that i regret and would never ever do that again. It was insecure and selfish and i suck for doing it. If nothing else I wish that you could forgive and understand me. but you chose not to. I do not want you to make me whole . I want to get a vacuum ( for the carpet ) and come and vacuum your upstairs...Just because i missed out on that simple pleasure. When we met you were on one side of the gaming machines and I was on the other, both of us had ears to our phones, looked up and locked eyes, in that moment time stood still, my heart skipped like three beats and i could not breathe...i did not know it for a very long time but at that very second I gave you my heart. ....you can keep it though...since i took back everything else i ever gave you ...its broken now anyhow....</div>                 ')[0];

I live outside Boston, so please don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not interested in meeting. Not a stalker here. Way back in 2005 there was a website called &#34;Wetlook University&#34;, featuring women swimming clothed in a pool at a house belonging to a man named Carl. I believe he has since passed away. I paid him to make a custom video of a girl swimming around the pool and jacuzzi in her jeans and 2 layered white t shirts. I mailed him the t shirts, and after a few weeks I received the video and photos. You were the model, and you were absolutely radiant in your soaked jeans and tees, despite the fact that a thunderstorm was about to hit! You could rock the jeans &amp;amp; tee shirt look like nobody&#39;s business. Anyway that was 11 years ago, you have probably moved on, gotten married (to some lucky dude) &amp;amp; are raising kids (I bet they&#39;re good looking). You&#39;re a lovely girl, and I hope you&#39;re well. I wish you health and happiness, and I hope you still like to wear your clothes in the pool! :) Anyway if you see this, just check in and let me know how you&#39;re doing. All the best to you, Christine,</div>                 ')[0];

Not realizing the only thing your proving is you had to notify the one you loved to either get him jealous or start a fight but either or doesn&#39;t really matter because the whole time you brought another party into it which clearly shows you had another guy on your mind the whole time! And now that you&#39;ve done that to me already I&#39;m sure every other guys will take notice of that to and only use you for one thing.in which case you would probably never have another true relationship.. good job if that&#39;s what your going for.

What if the man Doesn&#39;t Touch his women What if the man Doesn&#39;t call her Bad Names What if the man Spends all his time off work with his Kid/kids. What if the man even picked up his ex gf at a known Party house Didn&#39;t even hurt no one cause his exgf made stupid choices. What about if the man came to pickup his gf and child from her parents and the gf Had a fight with her parents then had a 2yr old in the van with over 100degree Weather my child was in sweatsuite with red Cheek&#39;s !? What about I had to work every day then come home and cook dinner for my gf and family while she is home all day with the children. What if the father payed his ex gfs phone bill still. But she was never happy But she is the victim.. She feels she has the right to Keep my Child from Me and then say I&#39;m A Bad Father. She does Not Allow my Child with me she keeps the baby from me I&#39;m going to be Honest She Shows me Characteristics of Someone With Bi-Polar Disorders. But I&#39;m Not A Good Dad Cause I Can&#39;t Be With Someone Soo Insatiable... To top it all off when she first found out she was Prego she wanted an Abortion . you would think a female that wanted to end her babies life before it started . Now I ask her just sign our child over to me but she won&#39;t do it. Cause She Knows I Love My Child With all my Heart. That&#39;s why she holds on to our child The truth Hurts But Only people with feelings. Her Actions Only Show Bad Judgment And Taking Advice from People that That don&#39;t even know how to wipe their ass Clean. But these Days I Guess Everyone is A PSYCHIATRIST!!... ANYWAY LETS STOP THE BASHING OF GOOD MEN Especially the Ones That Really try To Involve Themselves In their Children&#39;s Life&#39;s... How about all of us Men And Women Stop the Bs Stop the Lie&#39;s and Hate ....!! Most Women these day&#39;s are Insatiable with a topping of pure Ignorant... They think a perfect life is what Hollywood Movies And TV Shows tell us. They would rather take advice from someone paid to Relate To The Common Citizens!.</div>                 ')[0];

I&#39;m sure we will both move on and find a more compatible happy loving partner and I&#39;m happy just thinking about new beginnings and forgetting the old problems that always burdened my mind when we were together. You gave up fell out of love, I lost touch and completely lost myself pretending happiness or contentment faking excitement during sexual activities. I think you should know I didn&#39;t want you anymore than you wanted me I just used the familiarity as a crutch just being close to another human helps get through a tough day nothing special between us just another warm body. Thank god its easier this time around and I too wish you luck on your journey, you&#39;ve been super dicky lately and I can&#39;t express the excitement I feel to be ridden of this lie we called love. I don&#39;t want closure anymore I know enough and I know I am no longer in love that&#39;s when I knew it was over I had no more questions no more wanting to know the truth or how you felt, I just was happy I was right lol. So again don&#39;t apologize and please don&#39;t cry or try to explain it&#39;s not necessary were happier without this false sense of love and security you gave to us it never was satisfying, the sex, or the love, or the friendship. I always felt off with you and I&#39;m so happy knowing I can walk away without ever second guessing myself, you made that possible for me with your behavior towards me we both made our own mistakes yes but you topped the cake for years and I always gave you unconditional love and forgot that I&#39;m a top notch catch I&#39;m not the cheater, the liar, or the rude mean middle aged one. So thanks for the &#34;much needed&#34; closure it was great. Much love as always, not really though. From the last good thing to walk out of your life Ciao bella</div>                 ')[0];

I was the guy standing behind you waiting to order my simple venti coffee with an add shot of expresso, or to short phrase it, a &#34;red eye&#34;. I was waiting patiently but you had to order your tall mocha frap with light whip. At first I was getting frustrated, it may have caused me to start breathing a little heavy as I tend to do when I start getting frustrated, or nervous. You turned around and we locked eyes. The feelings of frustrations and pre coffee bitterness slipped away at that very moment. It was like, as if I didn&#39;t even need my coffee for a moment, I didn&#39;t need that morning boost of energy. It was as though the moment we locked eyes when you turned around to see who was breathing so hard,we fell in love instantly. Seeing as how I&#39;m as shy as I am, I couldn&#39;t build the nerve to spark up a conversation right then and there. We left at about the same time and I kept trying to build the nerve to spark up a conversation, but I couldn&#39;t. As we both got in to our cars I followed you. It&#39;s crazy because we drive on the same streets probably every day. We must have past each other many many times. As it turned out I followed you home. I wasn&#39;t completely sure if it was your house or not so I parked my car and quietly peeked through you window. At first I wasn&#39;t sure if it was your house or not so I quietly peeked through the window. As I watched you undress and get in the shower I knew at that moment it had to be your house. I was thrilled. I then knew where you lived. I am hoping I will run in to you at Starbucks again. I&#39;ve been there the last 4 mornings during the same time we locked eyes. I get there about 30 minutes earlier than when we first locked eyes incase you decide to get there a little earlier than your routine. I sit at my laptop for about an hour and a half waiting for you to come in. You haven&#39;t yet. Please don&#39;t get creeped out but last light I was finally going to build the nerve to ask you out. I showed up at your place with flowers but it appeared that you were sleeping, or weren&#39;t home. I went to the side window to take a closer look and I realized I was looking in your bedroom window. As I watched you sleep for a few hours, every inhale and exhale you took just overwhelmed me with so much emotion. I couldn&#39;t control myself, I started masturbating, maybe it was that nervous thing that I talked about earlier with my heavy breathing but it seemed to have woken up and startled your boyfriend, or whoever it was sleeping next to you. He got up and started screaming and ran toward the door. I knew it was best for the both of us if i just ran to my car and left. As I got in to my I couldn&#39;t just drive away. I had to pull over and finish the job. I mean I still had an erection I was trying to nurse. Well anyway. That cats out of the bag. You know I like you. I hope to see you at Starbucks tomorrow so we can continue down this journey we call life together. I will be there pretending to be doing important research on my laptop drinking my red eye, when in reality I will be checking my email to see if you responded to this ad.</div>                 ')[0];

You approached me in the club on June 24th, around... 1:30-2:00am? You had mentioned that your shift just started and thought I could use a dance. So far, these are pretty general statements, ha. Your voice and face caught my attention, and your subsequent dance left me breathless. Not to mention, you were my only dance for the night. A while later, you had approached me again, and my stubble-y, bespectacled friend intervened to see if you can find our bearded, lanky, and also bespectacled friend another lady for a double dance, which was followed by private time. Pretty sure that he nearly achieved Nirvana with you and Rocket. I had waited a while after that, looking for you from our table. Unfortunately, the guys were bled dry and didn&#39;t want to trade their kidneys for cash, so I left without seeing you again. I kept some cash from earlier, because I wanted to chat and ogle before leaving for the night. I&#39;d love to know if you intend to be in the Las Vegas area next summer. We&#39;ll be coming out again for another bachelor party, and it would be great to see you and the other girls we met. Otherwise, thank you so much for the very eye- and hand-opening experience on Friday. You are a vivacious brunette bombshell, and I hope to see you again. If you need any more information to confirm this, I can provide some info you told me or details from that night. Thanks Again, -M.</div>                 ')[0];

I tried to stick it out. I thought I could save her, but ended up losing myself to depression and shit. Why did she do so much fucked up shit? Why did I have to fall in love with an alcoholic fuck up? No, I don&#39;t even like her ass and Im angry as fuck! I harbor enough resentment in my tears to drown us both. I mourn our genuine connection, the essence of us. But it&#39;s a new day, and I&#39;m in Vegas for new beginnings and left her in Alabama. I hope she gets help... I worry about her kids... I hope that she takes the time to heal as I am. It&#39;s hard to accept that we drifted apart still in love. Once in a lifetime kind of shit. I wish her wholeness. I love her, and I hate her. But that&#39;s gemini shit.</div>                 ')[0];

I feel sad that you can relate to my story. Being in love with Casper is the hardest thing in the world. Certainly like nothing I have ever been through in my life and i do not wish it on anybody. I am living in hell now. I feel like a zombie. I am still sane enough to know that I do not want to stay like this forever. So I try to be as social as I can by meeting people and going out. Its not hard for me to have sex. What is hard is to want to be out having sex with someone other than Casper. I feel like I am on the outside telling me what to say and do next. Its hard for me to be in the moment because then i would know how miserable I was. Sick ass bitch I am ...If I could stop thinking about, loving and wanting him...I would ...but nothing in me is able to do that so far...but tomorrow is going to be a brand new day I am excited to continue living the life with the lessons i have learned thru my friendly ghost./ I have broken up with the best of the best...As a matter of fact i have the break up down to a science and am very good with it now....but NOTHING has ever thrown me like this .....I would have never imagined that i would turn into the person that I am behaving like now...its mind boggling ...I have lost all my self respect and dignity but for some reason i remain unaffected by my desire to be with the ghost of my dreams. I hope for your sake that you stay stonger and keep your self respect. its a good thing. Stay strong and be well...</div>                 ')[0];

It&#39;s mine, and it&#39;s only for me, and it&#39;s only for you. Mind you, not all of it flattery, but what good would writing serve, if it were only a recounting of joy? Some of it hateful, but should we find hate to be the opposite of love? The word doesn&#39;t even describe the lack of love. It would be more fairly characterized as love, &#34;discontented&#34;. Now, apathy is a word that should concern us both, as should its historical root, that is, sloth, which was something the clerics would have expounded upon, it being a mortal sin. Writing by design and history, function and purpose, is to express loss, to speak of tragedy, of passion unfulfilled, of longing, of remorse, of regret. Writers didn&#39;t write &#34;joystories&#34;, they wrote tragedias, comedias, tragicomedias, and dramas. Bringin&#39; mad drama is not a phrase known to help one ingratiate one&#39;s self to another. A writer is a depressing sight, elbows tight, shoulders hunched, pad and pen or (or notebook or tablet &#39;puter -- no, that doesn&#39;t work), looking pensive with tweed jacket and elbow patches, so deep in thought that he shouldn&#39;t be troubled with the mundane, the semi-retarded (yup, said it ..... and, sorry) 50 yr. old who, for some odd reason, came to Starbucks, and was destroying an iced mocha-latte with whip like a slurpee, not necessarily knowing what was gonna happen to him next, the writer juxtaposed, still pensive, ignoring him, yet now twirling pen &#39;round finger, as though something glorious would flow from it when point came to full-stop on pad, striking awe in the illiterate masses, who&#39;d be so impressed they&#39;d make him both their deity and regent. I have 2 tweed jackets, I&#39;ll havethe rest know, but I didn&#39;t need to be pretentious, because I had you, and you didn&#39;t need me to impress you. People didn&#39;t need to know how &#34;tortured&#34; I was about making sure I was smartly-dressed. Just kidding, I thought about stuff like the implicatons of no-entry zones in Europe&#39;s major cities, the placement of pseudo-communist/capitalist China&#39;s warships on the Philippine coastline to claim their below-surface oil and natural gas, Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal, the plastic soda-ring islands off the coast of Alaska, and, of course, fracking. Fracking monsters, I says. I&#39;d rather I didn&#39;t have need to resort to writing; It would mean I was so content, that my hands could be put to better uses, like ensuring that the inside of my elbow would pass over yours, and force a hug that I knew would make you scream like a baby and herky-jerk around because, &#34;[You&#39;d] told me how many times before, already!&#34;, that you were ticklish. I&#39;d rather put my hands to better uses, to jump inside the car to reach inside the shotgun door and flick the manual lock forward and left, and try to open the door before you could think to do it yourself, which you always did, but I still tried. I&#39;d rather put my hands to better uses, like using the back of it to place level with where the back of your forearms may have gone, when the car in front of us stopped too abruptly. Then, to let my right hand drop toward your lap, and give the nearest little kneecap of yours a slight squeeze. I&#39;d rather put my hands to better uses, like forcing my gentlemanly self upon you and slither my fingers in the slots of the plastic to relieve your hands of the weight carried by basic supplies from the 7-11, supplies we had to buy there, because of our fear of leaving the apartment unattended, a strange decision, it would be, to those who didn&#39;t know, but one we made together, like an old couple deciding on their afternoon buffet. I&#39;d rather put my hands to better uses, like initiating a game of slappy-hand, to demonstrate my handspeed, and finding out you were pretty damn quick yourself (but didn&#39;t tell you till later ; ) ..... ) I&#39;d rather put my hands to better uses, like slapping you on the rear, only to be told where exactly it was on your rear that you liked it best. I&#39;d rather put my hands to better uses, like throwing &#39;em in a pair of blue nitrile gloves and doing only G_d and you knows what with &#39;em. I&#39;d rather put my hands to better uses, like helping you put another pair of those gloves on your feet, and have your toes give the bird, screaming &#34;Fuck you ..... Motherfuckers!&#34; Now, wouldn&#39;t you rather I put my hands to better uses, than what I&#39;ve been doing with &#39;em, lately?</div>                 ')[0];

Still Love you and always will. But as time to look at everything goes on the one commonthread is that you only look at what I did or said. You refuse to look at or admit or even take responsibility for your own actions. I can&#39;t find any sense of Maturity or beauty in a person who lives to cause hate and pain to others. That makes person look ugly and pathetic. Finding a new life with othwrs who want nothing but my companionship. Willing to give up a lot to someone that shows me respect and honesty. Not sure that you know the meaning of the word but everyday I become more confident that I was not pushing to hard just responding to your demands and that is not who I am or how I operate. And you have no Idea what I am learning now but it has taken the physical side to a whole new level and I guess I just needed you to cheat on me enough to go find this young lady and start to rebuild. So again Thank you for that. It is much Easier now.</div>                 ')[0];

I felt compelled to give it a shot. Hi You were the one with red hair and webbed leggings (pretty hot, not gonna lie). You also had a group of friends with you. I was the guy with the brown hair, jeans, and the dam poor dance moves. I also was with a few friends who were visiting from out of town. We were hanging out at the table closer to the bar closer to the end of the night. At some point, I realized that you definitely had been giving me eyes throughout the night. Howeveerr, I AM quite the dummy and it didn&#39;t really dawn on me until later on that night xP. And by that time you were approached by another group and I was too shy to come by and interrupt before I had to take my friends back to their hotel. I figure this is the best chance I have at reaching you again. Email me with some specifics about the night for proof, like colors of what I was wearing or what my friends looked like and if/when you might be free again. (. . . a picture. . . a picture definitely would work as well =D ) I would love to talk to you and take you out sometime. Hopefully you&#39;re a local and/or that wasn&#39;t your last night here.

Seems like we&#39;ve known each other forever. Once upon a time we were best friends which later grew into a deep love anyone would be lucky to find. That love that only comes once in a lifetime if you&#39;re even lucky to be given such a special gift in your lifetime. I will never stop loving you. I don&#39;t ever want you to ever think my love for you or was a lie because our love was the best thing that ever happened to me. Nothing in my life will ever compare to what we shared, because you are the most remarkable person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing in my life. I can never move on so please don&#39;t think I ever will or ever did. How could any sane person move on with life after sharing a life with you and then having to let it go? I miss it. I miss us. I miss you. As the days pass I wonder how you are, if you&#39;re ok, if you&#39;re safe, if you&#39;re happy, all the most important things. I&#39;m so sorry things turned out the way they did. I thought we would have the life we always wanted together and a wonderful future, and I know we would have. But the things that happened has happened. I am in so much pain over the fact that I have lost you, you would never even believe the grief I am in. It crushes me just having to go a day without speaking to you. Every night before I sleep my tears pour for you as if a river was extensively jetting down my now permanent disconsolate, despondent face. Every day as I wake up, I can no longer smile as without you in my life there is no happiness to wake up to. As much pain as I am in, I wish I could take all of your pain away and put all of it into my heart along with all of my own pain that I feel. I just want you to be happy, and the fact that you may not be kills me. Please be happy mi amor because this world without your astonishing personality and smile would be such a great loss. Be brave, be strong, live your life how you want. I wish things would have turned out so different. If I could I would run across the earth and back if it would take back that horrible night. I love you baby and I will always be here. TI AMO SIEMPRE E PER SIEMPRE...only you would know what that means and know who this is from. Always know that and always have the comfort of knowing I&#39;m still here and you&#39;ll never be forgotten by me. Whenever you feel completely lost or alone remember you always have me thinking of you and loving you in my heart, never forgetting the magic that we had and that will always be there. True love is something that never dies or fades. I don&#39;t ever want you to remember our love as something that ended tragic or horrible, let&#39;s remember it for how strong and deep it was and always will be, how happy we made one another, and all the good times we had together. I know for sure that thinking of you and all the memories we had makes me smile...that smile that you loved so much. I hope that this and the memories of me still make you smile too, or if not now hopefully someday. Please remember today how special you are and how lucky everyone else is to have you in their life.</div>                 ')[0];

I never meant to do anything like that and the truth is I am dying without you. It&#39;s hard to go a day without talking to or being with you much less never again. I don&#39;t expect you to ever have a thing to do with me again, but I just want you to know that I do miss you. I love you and I will love you until the day I die like I&#39;ve always told you. I&#39;m sorry everything got so messed up and turned so tragic. I never wanted to put you in danger and believe me if I could erase that night I would do it in a snap. I hope you&#39;re happy and safe and living a good life like you&#39;ve always wanted and I do mean that with all my heart and soul. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever wanted for you and I hope you&#39;ve found it. Believe me with every piece of your being that I am not happy nor could I ever be without you in my life. I&#39;ve lost everything because of one stupid mistake, but losing you is the ultimate deepest kind of pain that I&#39;ve ever felt in my life. It&#39;s like a knife to my heart and might as well be. My heart feels as if it is bleeding and the air in my lungs feel weak because I can no longer feel you here with me. I feel completely hollow without you. Not just a half without it&#39;s better half, but completely empty. I can never be happy again, I realize that I have ruined my life...but I hope you feel at peace and realize what an amazing life you could have ahead of you and how loved you are by everyone. I will NEVER forget you or stop loving you. I love your heart. I love your soul. I love your personality. I love your intelligence. I love your beauty. I love your emotions, no matter which emotion your feeling. I love your laugh. I love the way you loved me and cared for me and I will NEVER forget that feeling or the feelings I will always have for you. I could never forget your fun personality or your beautiful eyes. Everything about you I will always cherish, love, and respect. Yes, I used to promise you a lot; as you did me and we have broken most of them. But the one thing that I always promise you that I can guarantee to promise you the rest of my life is my everlasting love. I hope you can believe this and realize it someday because you&#39;re too extraordinary to not know that you had the real thing. Deep down I will always know and believe that you are my true love and always will be. I don&#39;t expect to ever hear from or see you again after all we&#39;ve been through but I just want you to know and realize if not now then someday that somebody really did love you and we shared a really deep love and connection despite all of the things that happened that I believe will always be there. Our love is a gem. It&#39;s sacred. It will never die or expire. I just wish it was meant to be. But this is not about my wishes, my love; this is about you and your life. I know there&#39;s a very rare chance that you will ever read this, but if you do I am certain that you&#39;ll know that it is for you. You know who you are and you know who this is from, and I hope this puts that lovely smile of yours back on your face if even just for a second. I also want to tell you to please try to have a good life. The life that YOU want. No one can choose or decide for you...do what makes YOU happy. Your path is up to YOU. You just have to make it happen and you will find your happiness. You deserve it more than anyone. Please keep these words in your heart forever, because it is my advice and I would never advise it to you if I did not mean it. I truly would never want to see you unhappy or hurting...I want you to have the life that you&#39;ve always wanted and deserve. However and wherever you end up, never feel lost or alone in this world because my heart will always be loving you and my mind will always be thinking of you. I will always be here. My only request is please don&#39;t ever forget me...even when we are old and all of this is a sad memory. I love you more than life and I could never in a million years forget someone as special as you, and yes you are special. I know how your thoughts are because I&#39;ve always known you so well and I don&#39;t want you to ever doubt for a minute in your life that you&#39;re special just because I can&#39;t tell you that everyday like you should be told anymore. You will always have my heart. Be happy, be strong, be safe, and never be afraid to love and be loved. I DO HOPE SOMEDAY WE MEET AGAIN, BUT IF NOT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT UNTIL MY LAST BREATH AND THAT&#39;S A PROMISE YOU CAN COUNT ON. ALWAYS &amp;amp; FOREVER</div>                 ')[0];

It&#39;s ...... Time .......:  	I&#39;ve been quite ready to forgive, but it seems, you&#39;ve been content to remain, with deafening silence, among those with hardened hearts, even as you well know I continue to suffer substantially and physically, with very serious financial and legal liabilities still pending, with outcomes frustrating and uncertain. I have, quite literally, been driven nose to ground and, to that point, you had the luxury of saddle upon my back, with perfect timing to bail. I can no longer exercise forbearance of my right to speak, to testify, for a purpose which I see, as-yet, hollow. I imagine weathering another storm with hope of your love, but I can only ponder whether I would be as delusional as I was up to the moment before hearing your voice for the last time. You don&#39;t know until you do, unless you won&#39;t. I&#39;d been adhering to the tautology, a willing victim of inertia. Among many instances where I have been apt to question your commitment, your sincerity, is the matter of first place position in the &#34;bad bitch&#34; contest .... Would I be correct to doubt that you&#39;d relinquish &#34;the pole position&#34;, so to speak, after such hard work in the attainment, and risking the praise of all who&#39;d denied you it prior? I understand that need for validation, and I empathize with decisons made out of spite. But both are self-aggrandizing motivations, and anathema to the concept of partnership. As I&#39;ve always pled with you to do (from the very first time I&#39;d suffered injuries, and had naught but to suspect you as cause): (1) protest your innocence, loudly AND (2) make sincere attempt to avoid &#34;the appearance of impropriety&#34;; Make conscious effort to avoid connection with suspicious circumstances and, where such are associated with a harm, and you protest innocence, I likely would believe you are as you say. But you&#39;d failed to do so, so many times that I no longer questioned my ability to convey the lessons of the premise. You&#39;d too often appear as though caught with your hand in the cookie jar. In looking at each instance, I did have to consider the possibility, as you&#39;d often assert, that &#34;someone&#34; was trying to make you look guilty. I eventually had to admit, however, that one can play dumb only so many times before he who protests another&#39;s asserted mental inadequacy must take on the label, himself. And so, for a time, I simply would shake my head, and throw my hands in the air. I remember all of those instances that I just couldn&#39;t let go, to chalk up as an honest mistake or to a &#34;frame-up&#34;, and where it was just sketchiness served with sketchy upon etch-a-sketch (another of my sentimental possessions, ruined-I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s so many losses, I just stopped keeping track). These were times where you were just openly hostile: dramatically indignant denial coupled with a conditional break-up threat, dismissiveness, i.e., accusing me of sweating the small stuff, discrediting my motive, and blatant ad-hominem, insulting me regarding an irrelevant subject. I can imagine, in an ideal world, where one, simply, would take pause, take measure of what has been done, acknowledge what one has done, appreciate the magnitude, and value, of what has been lost and, THEREAFTER, endeavor to believe in one&#39;s stake in what remains, even if not memorialized, pen-and-ink on paper. And in that belief, behaving and making choices &#34;as if&#34; one ALREADY held it, so that one could most readily protect all that remains at risk, .... And then, simply, say, &#34;Sorry.&#34; And mean it. Truly. Really. And commit to doing what it takes to make full amends. Would I be foolish to place betting money on that path? A given choice merely half mine, you know what choice mine would be; You would not need be as mine, but you would need be with me .... The injuries and the insults, the potential skirmishes and scaramouch activity, continue unabated. But I refuse to lay down and die, to be certain. My silence has afforded me nothing but to forestall my own vindication. If it weren&#39;t already clear as day: Building a home, always, has been preferable to building a case. The respective merits so starkly in contrast, I&#39;ll leave them, unsaid. But I&#39;ll wait no longer to lay the foundation, for one or for the other, so I pray you understand what that entails, and find your way, to be at my side.</div>                 ')[0];
