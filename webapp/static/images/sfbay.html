Read ad for more info:  	You ever read these things and wonder why people don&#39;t just reach out to the ones they&#39;re posting for? I know I do when I read these things. Anyway I don&#39;t have a &#34;missed connection&#34; with anyone (and I&#39;d like to keep it that way lol). That said, I do think it could be cool/fun to go to Barnes and Noble today (I think I&#39;ll get there around 3:30 - 4ish) and maybe we can chat if you pick me out of the crowd lol. I&#39;ll be the dork who has anxiety and trying to not have a panic attack as I typically would not go out solo but I&#39;m pushing myself to get back to a normal life again (thank you anxiety and agoraphobia lol!) I figured this might be fun if I can actually make it there and not freak out hahaha. Aside from what I just wrote, I would love to have a new friend/s as I just moved back to the state recently and seems like everyone is caught up in their own lives. I always see so many pretty ladies walking around solo and I&#39;m wondering what I&#39;m doing wrong lol. I&#39;m shy but pretty cool once we get passed that part. Ok now I&#39;m wondering if this is a good idea or not lol. Guess we&#39;ll find out in about a half hour or so hahaha. Hints: I wear glasses, shorter than tall, average build.

The way you ended things was wrong and completely selfish of you. I thought better of you and even though I know what kind of person you are I still miss you so much. We didn&#39;t spend a great deal of time together but when I was with you I felt connected to you and saw a different person than the one your actions and lack thereof left me thinking you are. I&#39;ve tried to get over you. It&#39;s been the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever tried to do. It feels like I&#39;m losing a part of myself. I extremely sad when I think about how things went down and not being with you. I can&#39;t stop thinking about you. I know you don&#39;t care. Your online just like nothing&#39;s changed and I&#39;ve even met someone you met up with recently and they said your doing fine, back to your old self. I guess having sex with countless numbers of men is what you want more than anything else while love, intimacy, true connectedness, and passion have no place in your life except where it enables you to fuck another ass or suck another dick. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m saying any of this here except to say I just need to get this out of my head. I should have saw the signs and not listened to the things you said that weren&#39;t true. I wanted to trust you and I blame myself for allowing you to hurt me. I love you and I hate you but most of all I&#39;m sad and depressed all the time. I should just shoot myself to put myself and those around me out of the misery that I&#39;ve become because of you. I know there could never be any future for you and I. You made sure of that and I hope someday that you get to experience all the hurt, sadness and disappointmenr that I have suffered through because of you. You don&#39;t deserve love, ever except for the love that you have for yourself that makes you such a selfish inconsiderate prick.</div>                 ')[0];

You were gorgeous and your shoes were everything. so much happened.. never thought i be caught in an abuse cycle. I know i am a participant, you know i am not blaming it all on you. But the violence is just not acceptable .. :( And yet my love for you is undying.. 6 years now since we split, and we still keep our old patterns.. All i ever wanted was to be chill with you, be a family.. i craved shared friends. and you just didn&#39;t deem it all as important. what hurt most was being excluded from every holiday, you even forgot my birthday half of the time. you were busy and stressed and i made it all about you. i was happy to do that at that time. but u couldn&#39;t handle my love, i am your first and you have no experience. your parents didn&#39;t give u a good example of partnership too.. my neither.. so at the end we just never could build something mature. i am happy i am able to love someone on this earth the way i do love you, i love intense feelings.. and i never asked for anything in return. but u love to make it drama, talk about giving you space.. I never not gave you space, all u got was space.. i was boyfriend on demand.. and i was ok with it, cause i thought it helps you. but then came the abuse.. verbal.. physical.. the box of Pandora was opened.. you just lost respect and weren&#39;t man enough to let me go.. kept me around , basking in my love.. and i forgave and forgave and forgave.. we fought , i fucked strangers to kill my pain whenever we separated.. u couldn&#39;t understand why i do it, i explained to you so many times. every-time we fight my soul was ripped apart.. and as much as i like to add fuel to a fight, you were the one starting them out of nowhere, as i know now, just so i go away for a while and u can cheat and lie to some other boy.. ur inability not being able to have sex with strangers that u r so proud of, yes it makes you healthier than me.. but you having affairs, and tell boys you love them and then drop them and come back to me.. thats what i cant understand.. the grass is always greener for you.. and we kept forgiving each other, and moving on each time.. sometimes i think u never trusted me, my brutal honesty, you think its and act.. cause u have the need to cheat and lie and hide, you think everybody is like that. i told you few times, i never ever cheated on you.. till now my love for you is still greater than for anybody else.. i am trapped for 11 years now. and whenever i date u come and sabotage.. and i let you.. and now u r dating for 2 years already.. and in our friendship your favorite thing is to trash your boyfriend.. i told you its the worst dinner conversation. and yet you keep doing it.. how can i stay friends with u? especially that it also lets me know how u trashed me all these years, no wonder none of your friends ever showed respect to me. when we met u were so pure, u needed me, u were innocent, you were stressed, you wanted to jump start your sexuality. you chose me for sex only as i understand now... but how many hundreds of hours you spent telling me otherwise, how u admire me, and all i do, and my personality.. like a true sociopath you calculated what u think i needed to hear.. i don&#39;t think u still understand my personality, how immune i am to compliments or critisism.. i am sure i told you, but u don&#39;t listen, you just pretend you do.. and u do it so well, listening for hundreds of hours to my stories, my philosophies, my opinions.. just giving generic nods. yes i am a fool for not seeng that.. i am just not used to be scammed, especially not by someone i love.. hundreds of deeds over the years were committed by you to show me how profoundly you disrespect me. no opportunity was spared to show me my place on the totem pole with your family and friends. no chance spared to put them between us. use them as an excuse why you cant be there for me when i need you.. all the while i am on call, and spend days nursing u back 2-3 days after ur weekly &#34;stress&#34; day.. its all on me, it made me who i am ... u made me stronger and i am successful now on my own right.. you making millions of dollars yearly and not ever helping me.. making a point to ignore my struggles.. we eat out and you spent $800 on dinner.. And next day when u leave to your city, i eat in cDonalds.. how resentful i was then.. but more resentful about my ineptness to be disciplined with working.. you complaining that how are we gonna marry when i am poor, and your money will be running out.. well 11 years later i have $300.000 tax returns, i work my ass off. but its still not enough. i am sorry i don&#39;t have it in me to generate $5 million a year.. but nobody you know can do that.. anyways in the beginning it all didn&#39;t matter.. We lived like students in love, feeding on each others support and nothing was costing anything.. i always made a point not to take anything from you, felt guilty when u paid in a restaurant.. and u liked me being awkward about it.. now, years later i know you are just cheap. you found a whore that was free and you took her for a ride in your audi a8.. everything always revolved around money.. your parents had nothing.. and even they never accepted you for being gay, and never acknowledged me, they knew how to raise u a good son and make u pay for all.. them and your siblings.. you had no qualms to give your brother $80k a year for years.. but couldn&#39;t help me in a pinch.. at the end its all came out good, i had to pay back my student loans and instead of dealing with u i dealt with a bank, and paid all back within 2 years without drama.. i just sent my mom another $10.000 which i was able to do last years.. i learned how to take care of myself, and as u know i give u credit for that.. but still. u know i wanted to do more school, u know i am a valedictorian.. why not help me with my ambitions? i just couldn&#39;t get it.. i mean i know more now.. its a competition for u. your jealousy of my education, my looks, my sex.. you just had negative emotions.. and you are sociopath enough to mask them and keep me around.. same as i am addicted to your smell, and my true happiness is when i wake up in the morning and smell you.. that way you are addicted to watch me operate, do everything you despise, or secretly want.. you always praised our sex life.. i was wondering why u mention it so much, only now i know that was the nr 1 reason u chose me, not my personality.. and as i told u before, our sex was never that great.. u made me bleed every time.. and it takes u forever to cum.. don&#39;t get me wrong i loved every single time we had sex.. but only cause i love u, and i can handle pain easily. i don&#39;t think u ever will have the same, guys want to be respected and not hurt usually.. especially daily and always in the same manner.. and when u tried to be dominant with me, to give me what i want, i made u stop, it was just not believable.. always just wanted u to be who u r.. u like gentle sex, but it takes so long and its so big that it makes me bleed.. and your constant desire to be the bottom.. even that i gave u, not many guys can take my dick easy or for long.. so ur eyes were always bigger than your ass, and every-time i put it in you squealed like a pig, and thats the biggest turn off for me , to inflict pain.. of course i cant continue.. even that i am quite older than u and more experienced.. i am a bad teacher.. and its on me.. point is we had intimacy, more than anybody i ever knew.. i have never seen a couple like us.. our non verbal communication was top notch. whatever u lied, cheated, hurt me.. when i was holding you i knew the true you, and u felt the same i know.. i mean its still happening.. we are these 2 souls who are in love with each other.. but intellectually we despise each other.. and even physically we are not attracted to each other anymore.. u liked me when i looked like a Twink, skinny , awkward.. and i turned myself into a bodybuilder.. and i liked you big, your muscles.. your beautiful beautiful ass, which i was calling the golden globes.. yet, u had plastic surgery and removed your pecs, all the muscles u didn&#39;t like.. and my muscle bear is gone, replaced by an emo.. i mean of course i don&#39;t care, i am old enough by now not to care about physical appearances.. we both are beautiful to the world now, more than in the past. but we changed... i cant believe how ugly ur current boyfriend is. makes me shudder to think i looked something like him. and u keep trashing him, his intelligence, his looks, his taste, his ambitions.. you took a 22 year old semi hustler, just so u can disrespect him just as you did me.. :( i cant stand myself for being jealous still. i know i cant be with you, but i damn sure don&#39;t want you to be with someone else.. you trashing him, then sending him a message how u love him, then him hustling you for money.. i am disgusted watching this, and hate myself before all.. thats why i cant be friends with u, i just don&#39;t agree with ur conduct.. i don&#39;t want to see that. then all the traveling we did, with me planning everything out. and every trip a huge drama, cause u r petty and picky and whiny.. so i always not only have to work hard to keep the plans and schedules but also babysit you.. and then after, even now every time we meet you tell me how i organized the best trips of r life, and how amazed you are with how i make everything smooth and organized.. and how much u experienced.. well, all i remember was how hard it was to keep u happy.. and i loved doing it, i always want you to be urself, even if u r an ass.. i just wish u would quit being an ass sometimes, and to be fair u did have breaks.. i don&#39;t know.. when u were in europe for those few months.. and i missed u and i came to venice for a weekend.. 4 days of flying over holidays, to be there for 2 nights.. and ur flight was one hour.. my flight cost me $3000 which was huge money for me then.. and urs was $100.. and then u couldn&#39;t be nice and make it fun for me.. the only thing on you was to get the hotel, u offered it.. when u did&#39;nt book it timely u told me to look.. i sent u few choices, and to be fair i included a super budget hotel for $100.. All the others were like $600 a night and didnt want u to feel obliged to pay that.. you like nice places, i was sure u will either find something yourself or take one of my nice choices.. i was smiling when i saw u booked the cheapest.. i did tons of research, so even the cheapest was great.. and i ended up having my favorite window view in all of venice.. its just the room was so tiny, we had no space to move there.. and of course i just smiled, and it was on me for giving u that choice, and all i wanted was to see u.. but u spent all 2 days complaining about the tiny room, and didn&#39;t appreciate the view at all.. anyways, made me less guilty anyways.. yeah, a jolt of guilt every time you spent a cent on me.. in the beginning when u were pure u just were nice about including me in ur lifestyle when were together, even got me some gifts.. that box from nike made my year then.. i grew up so poor and monety was always such an issue, and in my family money equals love.. when u surprised me with a box of nike garments, worth maybe $250.. i was the happiest i ever was.. it was in our 2nd or 3rd month and then i knew u love me.. :) well, then i started to create the illusion of u loving me.. u just wanted to keep me compliant for sex.. but the fact that u would go chose cloths for me, think about them, and surprise me.. it was everything.. and u know how i admire ur style.. anyways back to venice.. i got complains, a kinda unhappy thanksgiving dinner in a place of your choice.. and ur obsession with 3 michelin stars restaurants is a huge waste of money sometimes.. towards the end of our relationship when u constantly complained for years that i dont make enough money and i started paying for dinners more than half of the time, and me paying it and spending hundreds $ few times weekly and u didn&#39;t even acknowledge it.. and just moved on to complaining about the next thing.. you are that father i never had, whom i could never please whatever i do.. i believed when u complained, i believed that the issue really bothered u and i would change it. and there was no feedback, a new issue arose from out of nowhere instantly.. constant blindside.. as i said it all pushed me where i am now, and its a place i couldn&#39;t fathom ever.. but still, if you have dozens of millions in ur bank, and u date a highly intelligent person, help him develop, support him to educate himself.. build him up, if its easy for u.. even if u don&#39;t think u gonna last forever, don&#39;t u think the guy will be grateful all his life to u. more than any of your family, where u spent hundreds of thousands on their universities, and they just kept dropping out and focusing on party and sex instead of the academics.. now i was fortunate that i did finish a masters degree early at an ivy league school, so it wasn&#39;t that i was uneducated.. my degree was just not in what i do professionally now.. and i wanted more foundation.. at the end being self taught gives me huge advantages now, and i am the one who educates kids after universities how to be productive in what we do.. and i get all the admiration and respect from my coworkers who graduated stanford and harward.. but few courses or degree from stanford would save me 2-3 years of self learning... to be honest i dated a few wealthy guys, too many, none as serious as you of course or as long.. none of them ever supported me, always kept my lifestyle to my means.. enjoyed the perks when i was with them of course, it was mostly older guys, i liked learning from success. i was amazed none of them wanted to help me with my educational ambitions, granted i never demanded it, or anything else ever.. but i did hint as to what i like to do.. i had a guy who was worth dozens of billions, and he was in my life for 3 years.. just hanging out whenever and wherever he wanted.. u know him, u were rude to him so we stop communicating... u didn&#39;t know him and actually asked him to stay at his penthouse in buenos aires, acting all entitled.. and i let u.. cause i loved u, and that billionaire didn&#39;t mean shit.. i was learning from him, so i kept in touch.. but this guy was an unbalanced insecure 70 year old.. i was 23, i don&#39;t know , i talk lots of shit.. so he would get upset, in the first weeks we knew each other.. and would throw a fit on the streets of paris, that i do something wrong.. who knows what.. and he would tell me, i can pay a million right now and fuck Brad Pitt in 9 hours, he would fly in here and instead i am dealing with u.. and even with 23 i was like, why don&#39;t u call him and are spending time with me.. i was perfectly fine on vacation, u asked me to fly here for few days and i came, and now u make me feel not welcome.. so after 2 weeks i knew i cant be with that guy seriously.. of course with 23 i thought the world revolves around me, and he has feelings.. and honestly that guy was so charismatic, and was so good in bed that at first i felt amazing, before i realized he cant feel secure with me.. at least he didn&#39;t let me feel guilty when he paid for dinners.. :) he was amazing.. i was just too young.. and little i knew he had boys all over the planet.. luckily i had my ambitions and quickly moved along my path, avoiding the faith of being an aged kept boy in some penthouse in south africa, rio or London.. so anyways, i would hang out with him 2-3 days every couple of months in either Paris or New York.. it got sleazy in New York once, when he left me at an event cause i he was tired and i was having fun.. and then his friend sort of came on to me.. and i was refusing, and then he told me in anger that my billionaire friend has boys like me everywhere and i don&#39;t have to play loyal, nobody expects me too.. that was a turn off, i never came out again to hang out with the guy, we stayed in touch until you were rude to him and demanded his penthouse, as if he owns u something just by proxy of liking me.. anyway.. money money money.. how u always like to say how it doesn&#39;t matter to u.. and of course u do have a different perspective, getting $5mio a year for many years starting when u r 21, its will drive u nuts.. but when i met u u were 23 and it didn&#39;t drive u nuts yet.. i was so in love with your attitude.. u didn&#39;t waste it.. u would spend $5-10k on restaurants a month and giving money to family.. food is your passion.. so i loved it, even the fact u didn&#39;t waste any on me i loved. luckily i was mature enough not to crave any chachkis anymore.. or $300 dollar polyester t-shirts with D&amp;amp;G; written on them in big letters.. many of these older guys i knew, would cover themselves in status symbols to compensate ( which i would do naturally too, and 90% of ppl ).. but u didn&#39;t give a shit, u just spent it on whats important to you, and otherwise didn&#39;t bother thinking about it.. or so i thought then.. turned out all u think about that cash, now that u retired before reaching 30.. $15mil in the bank is ok to live off interest, but u have to keep budget.. now ur head is twice as large as mine, and u were a valedictorian too.. u are finishing ur 3rd degree now.. i believe u got more to contribute to this world, and be rewarded more than before.. :) but u r surrounded by mediocracy.. all your fellow ivy league school graduates are mostly from rich families, they got $400k salaries right out of college, for little work, just knowing where to be.. and didn&#39;t acquire skills, and their lifestyles exceed their income. they all are unhappy, single. and all they want is to be u.. they think they are so smart with $15mil they could be doubling it yearly with smart investments.. i literally watched a not smart friend of yours, who was a glorified doorman in a hedge fund and raking in $500k a year beg u for chunk of your money so he can play around with it. well, he lost that job when his boss cashed out and is still looking for one 6 years later i believe.. i was surprised cause u do everything that guy says, and his opinion matters to u most. but your greed for money doesn&#39;t discriminate, just as u never invested into the company i had for a few years, watching me struggle ( while having tons of fun running it ) u don&#39;t invest in anyone.. so money on your mind.. and its not that u ever thought that i am after your money, i just did so many billion moves proving it.. but what changed, that now u became that person who disrespects regular people who work hard.. u adopted the attitude of your friends and their parents.. their parents are mostly foreigners who escaped regime changes and stole millions before they left, so they all investors who never worked.. i love working, and i am pulling 18 hour days easily when i need to get something done, i love contributing to the world in a significant way and be compensated.. and since i was brought up poor , abroad.. i am happy with having enough normally.. thats why i freelanced up until 7 years ago.. i just worked when i needed.. and spent free time on studying, getting to next level of my trade.. you couldn&#39;t stand when i am free, after 3 days you would be on my case to look for work.. of course u watched me a few times running out of money, and struggle, so u couldn&#39;t understand how i let it happen.. since i know u i worked all the time, and full time even in recent years.. but problem was u wouldn&#39;t let me save. i earned $8000 a month, and u would constantly talk about me having it and not contributing.. making me feel guilty so i would pay for the $300-400 dinners ( you were going easy on me not ordering $500 bottles of wine, just $150).. i paid utilities on your huge house ( just under $1000).. while maintaining my apartment in another city still ( for gods sake i never gave it up ).. so i felt u make me spend huge amounts of money on things i don&#39;t need... and i did it for 3-4 months.. and it didn&#39;t have any effect, u were still moody and angry and finding other things to complain.. then when i negotiated my first full time job, i got offered $100k and i was so happy.. i never made more than $85k a year freelancing.. and when i told u, u said i have to go and ask for $120k.. don&#39;t accept their offer.. i really wanted that job, i hate talking about money.. i told you no, its enough, and i am confident i will perform and get the raise i deserve.. you said you are going to leave me if i don&#39;t negotiate, in all seriousness ( prob first time when separating came up ). so i stepped all over my social conditioning, my peasant brain, my morals, my values and asked them for more money.. and i got it.. apparently you get if ask whatever u want, if they need u.. so you taught me things like that. which is good to know.. to this day though i hate negotiating, and usually my boss knows.. and every year i get maximum bonus and a raise without asking, just cause i perform highly ( compared to others around me, so it stands out ). and every time my boss would change and the new one was somebody i didn&#39;t trust in being fair i switched companies.. twice so far.. my last switch they didn&#39;t give me a raise when joining ( although i got $200k in equity ).. but after a year of being the best performer and putting my all in to it ( engineering a masterpiece ) i was curious as to how they will reward me.. and got $200k just in bonus.. not bad for the first year.. very hard demanding job as u know, but i am staying.. take that your friends who get same money by just sucking up to somebody. each cell of my brain has to stay active for over 8 hours a day to do what i do.. i am proud and happy about my work. although the stress is grueling , i don&#39;t know how long i will last.. but i put a lot of effort into my mental health and balance, so we will see.. i see myself doing it into old age.. of course now i have savings and some security.. and even can gift money to my mom.. which balances me too.. cause my parent even poor, supported me when they could.. young and reckless i would rack up credit card debt, and they took loans out to repay. where they live taxes are so high, that they only can live paycheck to paycheck. never had savings.. well my mom also splurges on chachkis, and my dad is the best specialist at a highly technical job, but they are the ones who instilled me not to negotiate and take what u r given and be grateful. well, we were immigrants to that country where they live, my dad got the job more than of couple of decades ago and they just give him tiny raises.. he is happy working there, all that counts.. but even for me, working full time it was a surprise that i have to pay 50% in taxes.. as a freelancer there were write off opportunities.. now any raises are eaten by inflation and jumping into the next highest tax bracket actually lowers ur take home salary even after a raise.. i do have enough.. and i love this country, and am happy to pay my taxes here and have the opportunities.. but i don&#39;t understand how they tax ppl with low income so much.. my dad makes $4000 a month, taxes are about 55% or so.. apartment is $1000 a month for a modest small 2 bedroom. they have 3 children, my siblings are much much younger than me. seems crazy to me that they don&#39;t give hardworking families like that room to breathe. now in that country they get free healthcare and free education, free universities. virtually no crime. unemployment is very high, but the unemployment and social benefits equal to what my hardworking father takes home.. its weird.. anyways i digress, and i digress very very very far.. this is all TMI.. this whole post.. but i been reading this section for dozen years.. and half of the posts are either what i would write, or some sound like u wrote them. we just had a fight again. since last 2 years, since u r dating this boy u went to rehab many times. u just had an overdose. why didn&#39;t it ever happen when i was there.. i nursed u through 4 last years of your difficult carrier as much as u hated it, everything was about u. your family , your friends everybody wanted that stream of income with their hands and mouths wide open. i was just there to keep u sane, and be a breath of fresh air. for years you took my energy and gave it to others. and then the violence.. didn&#39;t happen often, just 4 times in 11 years i know u.. but the nr 3 was when i left u.. in a 2 minutes decision.. packed what i could in my car and left. we didn&#39;t talk for 3-4 months.. one of your best friends, that girl was so supportive of me leaving u.. she talked to me daily when i was missing u, telling me to be strong and not contact u. i was so grateful for her.. so many good things happened at work in those months and i wanted to share them with u and resisted ( not that u would genuinely care, i know that. But i just love to share my good news with you. trying to make the daddy proud who is always not happy with me and my work and how much i make ). then turned out all that time she was working you, she had a business client who was obsessed with you, and she was matchmaking.. and u went on dates with him.. well, we made up.. became friendly.. thats when u went to school in europe for 6 months. u dated some guy, 2 u said.. i was so jealous but helpless, was focusing on my work. this girl who came between us, i obliterated.. such an unhappy creature. doesn&#39;t have a genuine bone in her body. so rotten. insanely rich parents, got best opportunities, graduated from best university. very little brain, lots of entitlement, is only advancing herself through politics.. i mean whatever floats ur boat.. But she knew me for 6 years, she knew how emotional i am about you and you about me. she always wanted to be around and you hated her.. and ur friends hated her.. u guys would talk so much shit about her. but she got u some benefits, and u got her access to some things. and i never let you be disrespectful about her in front of me, my pet peeve is when people are not honest and talk behind their back. they would even say to her face that she is an idiot and humiliate her in our circle, and she had such thick skin would always come back and suck up to then. granted she had a hard time with ppl, and they were the only close friends she knew since college. she must have been deeply lonely. so taking me, a provincial foreigner and play me like an instrument provided her entertainment. it didn&#39;t even enter my mind that i need to be protective of myself with her. i am not as naive. i lived on my own in boarding schools since i am 14, i was independent since i started walking. and with 6 i would stay out with older friends past midnight, and with 6 i knew how to navigate a 500k city. but such level of bitterness, disrespect and being sold so cheap.. back then i thought u need to be much older to achieve such a personality. well, by now i know that you discussed me the same way when i was not around. telling them i am temporary and focusing on my flaws and them eagerly helping u develop such thoughts cause i was one of the few things that was occupying your time and taking u away from them. and i didn&#39;t like any of them from the first sight. everything is a huge mind fuck, i hate how slow i am moving on. and you are not helping. happy to be free of your depression... but worried about u. i would be happy if you meet somebody who can compliment you in a good way and inspire you. somebody like me, but more selfless and closer to your social status. i just wanna be free.. free of money, guilt, worry.. i wanna date. i want to have somebody who respects me. who inspires me. i want a sophisticated partnership. i want someone fair. and someone not petty.</div>                 ')[0];

I&#39;ve accepted the fact that I&#39;m completely a of loser and have no problem writing shit on craigslist like a complete loser who believes in the Chinese zodiac. lol. I hope you forgot most of the nonsense I was rattling on about when i was freaking out. I still think of you often. Of course I have some issues of my own and being back home with my folks makes me realize how alike we really were. Of course I never thought of you as having a problem even though I was a bit shocked when i found out about your smoking habit. I overlooked it. To me you were perfect, and didn&#39;t need to change at all. Of course if you wanted help I&#39;d do whatever I could for you. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve moved on with your life by now as I have. You&#39;re probably doing better than me. I drifted around wallowing in misery for several months until I met this 21 year old blonde hottie at the st. patricks day parade. I swear she could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch. I was happy again. We hit it off right off the bat. of course someone before me had to fuck the bitches head up and she couldn&#39;t trust me even though I stayed loyal completely and dropped two other girlfriend prospects i had. She turned out to be a total swamp moose and a head case. she fucked around on me and was keeping me a secret and playin head games and trying to tell me I was weak for caring about her. Just about two weeks ago I called her a cunt and told her to kill herself, and I was gone git me a woman who treated me right. She&#39;s a hooters girl now. You treated me right. even if it was only for a short while. I&#39;m sorry if I caused any trouble. I don&#39;t even want to know what kind of shitstorm went down when I left. I told my friend Ron what happened and I hope he kept shit quiet. If he follows the code he lives by he should have. I&#39;ve been hangin out with the club with some regularity. (the one your dads in) Theyre kind of unavoidable considering we drink at the same bar where only great men go. Got some really bitchin support gear. We&#39;re getting along alright. I&#39;m learning alot from these people, working hard and improving myself. Long story short I hope you&#39;re doing well. I doubt you&#39;ll see this because I know you&#39;re too cool for this shit. Love and miss ya. -the dirty city dragon.</div>                 ')[0];

We met last weekend, and from the minute words came out of your adorable little crooked smile you made me melt. I have not felt this way about somebody in a very long time. You keep swimming around in my head and I cant shake the feeling you have given me. You also said you felt a strong connection, but sadly I know you are taken, I hope he is the best thing ever for you. You deserve nothing less. I wish situations could be different, as I would defiantly love to spend more time with you, drink you in, and have more &#34;rad&#34; experiences. I have never met somebody who checks all the boxes for me the way you do. Either way, you give me hope that there are still amazing women in the world, as I was about to give up. For this I will always be grateful. Thank you.</div>                 ')[0];

He then asked me a couple questions about it. After we paid he gave me the sweetest smile and I regret not furthering our conversation more.

I just want to say it so it&#39;s out of my head. You ruined me. Flat out ruined me for anyone else. I can&#39;t listen to the temptations without thinking of you. Especially, I aint to proud to beg. My girl. Im losing you(I know) I wish it would rain. Aint no sunshine....I remember when I played it for you. Still beaks my heart 10 years later. The whole first love thing sucks, especially when you thought you found your soulmate at 13. Im still with the same guy from after you broke me. 8 years. 8 years and I know you can love someone but I still don&#39;t believe in true love. Don&#39;t believe in marriage. Don&#39;t want kids. If you really loved me you shouldn&#39;t of put my phone number on a party line. After I learned of your painful lie and intentional heart break there was only one thing you could of done to make it right....and it wasn&#39;t playing all those sad songs or depressing voicemails. You should of came to see me. You should of left then without a second thought, and told me you were outside. I wouldn&#39;t of ran or hidden from you. Just like that. A simple gesture showing me how much you loved me, how much you didn&#39;t want to loose me. How much it hurt you feeling and hearing my pain and sorrow. Besides seeing you, holding you....all would of been forgiven. Just one kiss from you would lead to an overwhelming passionate night. Healthily releasing all our anger an tension onto another. It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t ever think of the day I unintentionaly broke your heart. I ask myself would we still be together today? If I literally went to safeway to see you. Smh. I don&#39;t know how you felt at the time, but I was mad you broke up with me...didn&#39;t speak to me in over a year. Heartbroken really. Just starting to move on. No more staying at home grieving for what I never really had. Then you just call me out of the blue. You wanted to see me? Wtf? Why would I want that pain again? Oh but you gave it to me worse than I imagined. I should of protected my heart. I know that if it wasn&#39;t for hundreds of people calling and harassing me from you posting my number......I would of never let you go. I want you to know....you let me go, because you pushed me away.   I lost part of myself in you, that I fear Ill never get back. ~~ Stephanie ~~</div>                 ')[0];

I was on white sheet with colorful towel. You younger good looking guy with blonde beard. Showed you my talents. You asked me how you tasted. You&#39;re cute in black workout pants and gray speckled top, sunglasses, hat, black underwear. Me naked, sunning, with sunglasses and beige hat. Would like to see you again or be a FWB.

A simple gesture showing me how much you loved me, how much you didn&#39;t want to loose me. How much it hurt you feeling and hearing my pain and sorrow. Besides seeing you, holding you....all would of been forgiven. Just one kiss from you would lead to an overwhelming passionate night. Healthily releasing all our anger an tension onto another. It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t ever think of the day I unintentionaly broke your heart. I ask myself would we still be together today? If I literally went to safeway to see you. Smh. I don&#39;t know how you felt at the time, but I was mad you broke up with me...didn&#39;t speak to me in over a year. Heartbroken really. Just starting to move on. No more staying at home grieving for what I never really had. Then you just call me out of the blue. You wanted to see me? Wtf? Why would I want that pain again? Oh but you gave it to me worse than I imagined. I should of protected my heart. I know that if it wasn&#39;t for hundreds of people calling and harassing me from you posting my number......I would of never let you go.

I am truly sorry for any hurt I have caused you, and continue to cause you. I am reaching out in hope to resolve this. I let you down as well as myself. I was going through so much, as were you. Everything I did was for you and for us. The date of our separation passes once again. My heart is heavy. I understand my efforts are as futile as was traveling to see you. I was misguided, and blinded by love. My heart hurts, aches. I am scarred by all that has happened. Right or wrong this is the pain that I will carry with me until the end. I believed in a fairytale romance and was so foolish in doing so, you warned me yet I pursued it, your words were that this is an unreal fairytale. These words ring true in my ears and in my heart. Love is defining and does not bind us, it lifts us, it gives us things we could never have imagined. You gave me so much and for that I am very thankful, although it also saddens me. I have a pure and loving heart however I realize that I am far from perfect. I have to forgive myself for the choices I have made, for I have constantly placed myself in danger by following my heart. I feel like a fool for what I did. Unfortunately this feeling is something I will never be able to resolve within myself. I should never have pursued you but I fell for you. Life will never be the same without you for you had a profound affect on my heart and my soul. I remember everything you went through on a daily basis. Your strength keeps me strong but I have my days when I just want to cry but my tears have truly run dry. I truly hope that you are looking after yourself, both personally and medically. I also hope that you have been able to move on from this in a healthy way. I want you to be happy and to find never-ending happiness. You have such an incredible heart and mind. I hope that you are nurturing both. I wish you all the happiness in this world and beyond. I write this with all the love I have for you in my heart and in my soul, and that will never change no matter what I go through I will always feel this way about you. (SM) it is entirely up to you should you read this whether you choose to write to me. I know we are both hurting. If I speak with human eloquence and angelic ecstasy but don&#39;t love, I&#39;m nothing but the creaking of a rusty gate. &#34;No matter what I say, no matter what I believe, no matter what I do, I am bankrupt without love.&#34; I fell in love with you not by choice nor by design but by chance. I am not writing this to win you back for that shipped sailed long ago and it isn&#39;t healthy for me to be around you. I want to be clear on this. I just think we should have one last conversation so we can get closure on everything that has happened but again that is your choice. Love TG &#34;I hope that time will heal our hearts And that in time you will understand Why I said goodbye, even though I really do love you The hurt we both feel was never planned&#34;</div>                 ')[0];

I tend to be shy but am working on it. I told myself that if you happen to look my way...I would smile. I started gassing up and when I turned around and looked up, you were sitting in the drivers seat of your truck and looked over at me. Unfortunately I froze and my insecurities took over and I thought &#34;no way would he smile back at me&#34; ...so I chickened out and feigned interest in my phone. :( I really regret losing my courage that day. I&#39;m not expecting anything to come of this as that was a few seconds of time a year ago that you probably don&#39;t even remember. And you may not even work at that station anymore. But I&#39;m just putting this out there into the universe that I wish I would have had the guts to smile...if only to help me expand my comfort zone. But thanks Mr. Fireman for giving me something to think about and strive for. If this miraculously finds its way to you...do you even remember the brief encounter? Perhaps we can have coffee to help me with my shyness?</div>                 ')[0];

I needed a place to stay the night, and it would have been awkward very awkward if you didn&#39;t want to go any farther very awkward if your leg was rubbing me just because that was the comfortable angle not because you knew it was right on my cock.. not because you could feel what it was doing to me but then I kissed you. you grabbed me, it was over we ran up to your room and got naked you said me friends name.. it was so cute, you asked, &#39;she wont be mad will she?&#39; you didn&#39;t want to get in trouble she&#39;d texted me that morning, said you were sexy and that i should go for it... i guess we needed permission you took your leg off and crawled over to me i had never been with someone with such an ass before; my ex was less than a hundred pounds and the ladies i&#39;d hooked up with in the interim were not so well endowed with your wonderful ass and one leg, it was the best doggie style i&#39;d ever experienced... by a long shot in the morning we woke up together and you asked me what i wanted, of course i wanted a blow job it was the best I&#39;d ever had, you had crazy skills and i was half afraid you were going to tickle my butthole when i came you ran a finger up from the base to the tip to milk the last drops out... thats something i do for myself, but nobody else ever did it right you gave that squeeze and milked the last bit out and sucked it dry that stays in my mind years later I didn&#39;t stay, i didn&#39;t know if I could ever leave if i stayed any longer. there wasn&#39;t much for me to do there if I did stay, it was a small town and all my stuff was somewhere else. I was still married too, so... I had to go. No idea what could have been; i don&#39;t think we really clicked or could have been more than that 48 hours, with the fresh crab and the ice cream cone, and your dog jumping to lick my toes at the worst times during drunken sex but i remember you i salute you, and hope you&#39;re well</div>                 ')[0];

You were nice enough to let my two friends and I go in front of you to get a better view of the stage. By the end of the night we were having casual conversation, as the exit cleared up, and my friend was completely drunk. You were with your sister and cousin and mentioned you were from Oakland. My friend, of course in her state, kept making sexual comments about us which completely embarrassed me as your sister and cousin were hearing, I seriously wanted to hide under a rock. I wish we were able to chat a bit more and you seemed sincerely really nice and took my friend&#39;c comments with such ease. I wanted to give you my number, but under the circumstances I felt it was way too awkward and I just shaked your hand goodbye.

We met at Cosmo after hours and had an awesome connection. You were wearing an island shirt and a black wide-brimmed fedora. You had a little bit of facial hair. At one point, you tried on my buffalo sweater, which honestly looked sexy on you. You&#39;re a biter. You asked me why I didn&#39;t have a boyfriend. You had a lot of friends there, one of whom was a pretty black girl. There was another guy on the couch, but I don&#39;t remember his name. We agreed to hang out again in the future. My night got cut short when someone stole my cell phone (got it replaced). I thought we exchanged numbers but I guess we didn&#39;t. Here&#39;s hoping that this somehow reaches you. If you think this is you, please reply with what I was wearing (other than the sweater) and/or what my ethnic background might be.</div>                 ')[0];

You went to another section of the locker room, but then, brought your gym bag to where I was and stood there with just a t-shirt watching the TV as you took your time putting on your underwear. It seems like you were trying to time it so we left together. We walked out to the parking lot only to discover our cars were right next to each other. If this is you tell me what I said to you or what transpired at the cars. I think we were both a little too shy (scared?) to engage in a meaningful conversation. FYI. I am a happily married, to a woman, bisexual man. I don&#39;t often seek out other men but every now and then there is some mutual energy. I thought we had some of that underneath our fear of exposure. Hope to hear from you.</div>                 ')[0];

I missed you. You are in your 20s, tall probably 5&#39;8&#34;, Caucasian, slim, short blond hair, lovely blue eyes, with a very handsome face, a slight cleft chin which makes you even more handsome, and a smile that simply melts my heart. I had seen you at work a couple of times before (you did the afternoon shift then). I admired you from a distance only, until you actually served me as your customer one fine and fateful day. That was the time when you took down my order for iced tea. We had a very brief conversation in the course of ordering, but it was lively so much so that we both ended laughing. Later that same evening, as I sat sipping my beverage at a table beside the glass windows, you twice smiled warmly at me through the glass from the outside, while you were stacking the sidewalk cafe chairs to be carried into the store for overnight safekeeping. I wanted to start something between us, to converse some more with you then, to befriend you eventually, to get really close to you personally, and hopefully to become intimate with you on life&#39;s many different levels and dimensions. But shyness and fear that your co-workers might notice and tease you overcame me. So, I silently watched you in admiration of how handsome you look and what a beautiful person you are. I still dream of having a relationship with you built on mutual acceptance and appreciation. It might not be easy considering our age difference, perhaps differing sexual orientations, and separate worlds. But I do not want to miss that opportunity if it presents itself as destiny calling. I do hope you get to work the afternoon to closing shift again. You have less co-workers around and the pace of work seems to be relatively slower and relaxed.

You and only YOU can and will correctly know who I am in the context of this ad. Your name is S_ _ v _ n. Come to me please. ;-)</div>                 ')[0];

I sat on the seats assigned for the elderly, disabled, and pregnant people. (Don&#39;t worry, curious readers, no one that fits that description was in the train.) You stood the entire time just five feet away from me. You are so cute. You have brown hair and large brown eyes. You wore glasses and had your earbuds in and a backpack strapped to your back. You wore jeans and a nice shirt, your stomach was showing a bit because you had your arms up holding the bars. I was nervous and looked away at first, but then gained some courage and looked back. I definitely was giving you the eyes. As you were walking out, I smiled at you and said bye flirtatiously. You probably have a girlfriend because you look so put together.

No I only wanted to, needed to, understand why when you said you loved me you could do what you did. Does that make me mean and hateful? Does my professing I love you make me a hateful person? And Effeminate? Or is it that you are ashamed of how you acted and everytime I write something about how I feel, it reminds you of your awful behavior towards me. I was never equal to you because you never gave me the opportunity. So how could you ever see me as a partner? You can&#39;t just scoot people under the rug and expect them to disappear like you do. That&#39;s why I have written here because you took away my voice when you shut me out without reason. That&#39;s why any of this came about was because of your inaction so continue to blame me. Meanwhile I suffer because I don&#39;t have you, the person that I fell in love with in my life, to do all the things I long to do with and be with. I&#39;m my own person, independent, strong, dedicated, and i was a very happy person, go with the flow kind of person, until you decided to make me wait to see you again and then disappeared when I said anything about your seeing other people. You would make me wait to see you again until after your treatment was over but you were still online (hooking up with other people?). Why would you still be on line? You made me feel I wasn&#39;t important to you. Like I had to wait behind everyone else in the world you wanted to have sex with until you decided it was my turn again. Keep it. I don&#39;t want to be in a monogamous relationship let alone an open relationship where the person I love and they say they love me would put me second to anything at anytime. That&#39;s exactly what you did. So go ahead and continue trying to hurt me. You can&#39;t hurt me anymore than you already have.

I&#39;ve been kicked to the curb for no reason. I&#39;ve been disrespected, hummiliated, talked down to, brow eaten, stolen from, everything that I had let to my name, and told , it&#39;s not my responsability to watch your things . Yet it&#39;s my fault if someone has taken something from you. I have worked my ass off , and never even got offered payment of any type, never even asked for any. I have given my last few dollars then left on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere . I&#39;ve been left in a storage unit in the middle of the night, just after we had sex. No bye no nothing. And I still blind myself to the fact that your using ME For WHAT EVER YOUR US ING ME for, I WAs There WHEN YOU Were Down To NOTHING and gave you a place to go, and you made sure you took control of that, I&#39;ve been there when you had nothing and I helped you when Noone else woukd, and when you came back up, instantly I was kicked to the curb,. But yet I still blinded myself to what ever you are using me for... I have nothing. I gave it all up for you, yet you take the last of what I have without blinking an eye... how can you do this and not feel guilty..? My love for you is deep, cause I thought there was a side to you that was just awesome , that you were going through a phase from when we met.. but I think the side I thought was who you wee , was the fake , and this is the real you. Because you seem to have no feelings . I&#39;m just a sucker that you found to use till I finally got fed up with. I&#39;m tired, lost, alone, scared,sad, hurt, and confused... I know you don&#39;t care, but I had hope, I believed that you might NE day see that my love for you was from my soul... and now I see that , I AM the dumb bitch who&#39;s stupid enough to keep giving, and your the smart one to keep taking as long as I am willing to keep giving... I keep saying to myself, ,&#34; someday you will want me, or miss me, but I don&#39;t believe you will ever, I dont think your capable of loving anyone but you. I don&#39;t believe you have any feelings at all,. You&#39;ve been hurt and stripped of them... well .. I am human, and you have hurt me so bad... this is my last outreach to you. If you care at all, you will come find me... but I don&#39;t believe you will, so I&#39;m not gonna hold my breath. . You will never see me again if you dont, because I have opened my eyes. I hurt so bad I wanted to die, but I cant let you do that to me or my kids. This is the last time I will reach for you... my hopes are not high, so I guess I should say good bye to you now... I love you and always will. You have taught me alot.. I thank you for this... I will however miss or sexual energy,, I have to admit, it was awwwesome . I may never find another like you... my soul will never be the same... I&#39;m gonna pray tonight for the first time in like 30 yrs, I hope who ever or what ever hears my pain, and brings you to me... night superman,, love forever,, ( ratchet)</div>                 ')[0];

I encounter all sorts of people, mostly nice, but some strange too. I&#39;m always professional even when some riders challenge you to remain so. You were something different. Something wonderful. Something an average guy like me probably doesn&#39;t deserve. Beautiful would be just a cliche to describe you. You were kind, sincere, sweet, understated and graceful. The moment you said your name to me to confirm, your smile and soft, kind eyes just melted me. I think I fumbled my greeting to you, I can&#39;t really remember. You asked me how I was doing and told me about how much you enjoyed being in the bay area after only a few months. We chatted just a bit more about little things as we rolled along. My app says our ride was only 12 minutes long but it seemed like an hour. I dropped you at your destination and you took the extra moment to lean back in the car with a glowing smile and tell me by my name, &#34;thank you for getting me here safe. You are a good guy.&#34; Not wanting to appear creepy in this situation all I could say was &#34;Thank you. I hope you have an amazing day&#34;. Boy, was that a lame-ass response to someone who just shook my world up. But what else could I say? Story of my life, it seems. I know you will never see this but I like to think that you might remember me. I just needed to let all this out to someone.</div>                 ')[0];

I&#39;ve been in my room for weeks now, binge watching Gilligan&#39;s Island and pushing fluids, mainly Mai Tais, Margaritas, and Salty Dogs. And anything with an umbrella. I find it terribly confusing. If only the Redwood forest had coconuts... then, perhaps, I too would be capable of a more evolved and gentrified existence. And that&#39;s not the only thing that&#39;s keeping me reliant on room service. I have come to realize that each show leaves the most crucial question unanswered after the plot conflict has been resolved. I was well through the third season before I started to get an inkling. The egg in my beer is that now I can throw together a pretty decent search party. But who couldn&#39;t on that island. I think I need some space. Big</div>                 ')[0];

Shari was on the younger end. There was an adopted black sibling named Angie, I know one of the older brothers was Bruce. These siblings I&#39;m not aquainted with would probably be well into their 70&#39;s or 80&#39;s by now..... Sharon (Shari) died in 1998 in her home in Petaluma, all of her and her ex-husband Lawrence Scribner&#39;s family is lost to me. I have never met anyone other than Bruce and Angie and Angie&#39;s daughter Angel when I was very very little. Being that I now live in Marin county and am so close to these roots, I am hoping that since it was a large family perhaps someone will recognize someone I am related to. I&#39;m interested in the history and family pictures. Thanks.</div>                 ')[0];

You told me hat you had to choose one of them for a class and we walked over to the one you chose and I took the photo of you with the painting. Then we walked over to the Native American gallery and kept talking for a couple of minutes. You seemed to like the huge painting and I told you it was made in 2013. Then you said something else and then &#34;thank you&#34; and you went to look at that painting. I said you are welcome and stood there contemplating how you pondered on the painting. I felt like talking more but I&#39;m somewhat shy and was afraid of annoying you. I really enjoyed listening to you and would like to know how you did in your class. When you were done with that painting you turned around briefly and looked at me and then you walked over to the next gallery. I didn&#39;t know what to do. If you&#39;re reading this I hope you remember me and if you&#39;re interested I&#39;d be honored to be friends with you. I want to be your friend.

Mostly on a whim and out of boredom. I get dozen of repiles and have yet to answer a single one until you emailed me. Imagine, someone sharing their thoughts, aspirations and ideas. Not once did you ask for a photo. Not once were you ever vulgar. I couldn&#39;t wait to meet you. You mentioned your race as if it was an issue, when I saw you in person, I couldn&#39;t help but be smitten by the color of your skin. As beautiful as the Cuban players from baseball. I loved how you talked about your career and the crazy old yankees fan/friend who wore sweatpants and was retired. We all know a crazy Yankees fan, right? I left that night thinking someone who moved to the bay area to start their career and is still fiercely loyal to their small market team is something pretty special. I wish you gave me a chance. I hated how you&#39;d push me away with your endless questions of &#34;why don&#39;t you date one of your friends&#34;. We live in the bay area, can&#39;t you tell their all Giants fans anyway? I wish I could have been more clear or coherent on what I was feeling, which was fascination. I wanted to know all about you, to know what it is you taught, what your daily routine is like. You said you don&#39;t like talking about yourself but instead wanted to know about me. I hate talking about myself. I work endlessly and watch a ridiculous amount of mlb games. I knew as you avoided to meet up, I could tell you weren&#39;t interested.. I wish you all the best and I hope your team has a healthy and happy season. Don&#39;t work too hard.</div>                 ')[0];

I will not carry guilt for things I said when I was angry, sad, extremely desperate and crazy. Or carry guilt for falling for, falling in love with you. That was one hell of a trip. I don&#39;t think we should ever feel guilty for loving another. Life and where we come from, screws with our head. Don&#39;t be sorry. It&#39;s okay. I love you. You said some things, but I knew you did not mean them. That&#39;s why I continued to love you to this very day, July 21, 2016 and even beyond this day...all the way to eternity. A long time to love someone... a really long ass time. I didn&#39;t want to bring a pain game to your life I wanted to love you. I do and did. Whatever.

A year ago on a Thursday evening (June/July 2015) I pulled into the Rotten Robbie gas station kitty corner from the fire station. I noticed you gassing up but your back was to me. I tend to be shy but am working on it. I told myself that if you happen to look my way...I would smile. I started gassing up and when I turned around and looked up, you were sitting in the drivers seat of your truck and looked over at me. Unfortunately I froze and my insecurities took over and I thought &#34;no way would he smile back at me&#34; ...so I chickened out and feigned interest in my phone. :( I really regret losing my courage that day. I&#39;m not expecting anything to come of this as that was a few seconds of time a year ago that you probably don&#39;t even remember. And you may not even work at that fire station anymore. But I&#39;m just putting this out there into the universe that I wish I would have had the guts to smile...if only to help me expand my comfort zone. But thanks Mr. Fireman for giving me something to think about and strive for. If this miraculously finds its way to you...do you even remember the brief encounter? Perhaps we can have coffee to help me with my shyness?</div>                 ')[0];

Have a great life. Although I do have to say, it really isn&#39;t up to par with your standard that I have experienced. The content lacked imagination, the length was much to short, and the videography left a lot to be desired. Really much lower standards than some of the other work I&#39;ve seen you do or I for that matter. Not really sure what the purpose of my seeing you having sex with another person, let alone you being topped has anything to do with me. I&#39;ve said on many occasions it never is the fact that you fuck around with other people that bothered me, its the importance that you place on other people over say your primary partner that left something to be desired. No I was not shocked at watching you have sex with another person. I&#39;m glad you are being active sexually and happy about it. It just tells me that any time we spent together really meant nothing to you and I was just another knotch in your bedpost and not at all someone that you wanted to seek something more with at all like you say. Live and learn bitch. Live and learn. You have succeeded in taking from me sense of love or anything positive I could have drawn from the year and a half we spent I guess it would be called using my ass and throat for your needs. You really had me fooled by the things you said and the way you treated me, I thought I was special. Thanks for making sure that I knew differently now. Please continue fucking and getting fucked your way through life. It seems to work well for you and I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to take any of that away from you since you seem to think it is what defines you. How empty and lonely you must feel sometimes, until you can find or schedule the next person over or under you and the next one and the next one. You&#39;ve really opened my eyes to the true person you are and I have to say you are nothing like the person I spent getting used by over the year and a half I knew you. Thanks for helping me to not waste any more of my time seeking something you only dangled in front of me like a carrot. It was never something that would have been a reality.</div>                 ')[0];

The first time you came up you tried to order a single shot mocha but I talked you into a half caf instead. We were definitely flirting because I just couldn&#39;t help myself. And you came up a couple more times to the register saying &#34;round 2&#34; and &#34;round 3&#34; being all ridiculously cute. The next day I was off but I had to stop by and there you were on the couch studying again, looking even sexier. We kept making eye contact while we were both there and I have the feeling you&#39;re thinking exactly what I&#39;m thinking. I&#39;m writing this because I&#39;m looking for something new and fun because my sex life has been kinda down in the dumps lately. If you&#39;re looking for something NSA before you have to head back to college for the semester please, please, please hmu.

There is something to be said with that. If you put your mind to it you are able to do anything. If only you could have applied that to us and ensure our future together. I know you feel as though we couldn&#39;t make it in life but that&#39;s not even close to what I experienced. What I saw was two loving souls faced with adversity mainly because they were trying to be together but living separate under stress and outside influences always a problem for the both of us. I believe and always will believe that you are my one and only true love. No matter how fucking fucked up you are towards me. The bullshit hurts really bad and I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how much I hurt and doubt and cry trying to let you go. I would have never been able to do to you what you are doing to me. It really fucking sucks because I think your just chicken to commit to anything you can&#39;t run away from when it gets to be to much. Through your whole life that&#39;s what you have done . When we met you said you were destined to be alone. Well now you might have a temporary fix to your immediate fears and problems but I know how strong our love for each other felt when you allowed us to be together and I don&#39;t know how to give up and run away. So I&#39;m going to make my life mine again and just hope you realize how important we are for each other . If life ended for me or you tomorrow would u be happy because you had a car and house. Would you be with the one you love the most would you regret never trying harder and making us work growing old and happy with one another? I know u won&#39;t answer but God brought us together for a reason just as he got me out of jail a day before u ditched me. He also made it so we ran into each other at the Bart station. When are you going to quit making things so hard on yourself when life is really easy if you let it be . I&#39;m sorry for everything you need that you don&#39;t have. I wish you all the best of luck with the choice you made. Yes I&#39;m pissed off you broke my heart your promises to me but most of all I can love no one ever again because of you.</div>                 ')[0];

Anyway, we had such a great time, at least I know I did. I told you that I hadn&#39;t had that much fun with a girl in at least 6 years. I know I acted like I didn&#39;t care that you said all you wanted from me was sex, and that you were going out on a date with another girl the next day, but I really do care, a lot. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that I like you a lot, and I wish that we could be together, but idk, for some reason I feel like right now is just not the time to tell you that, maybe now is just your time to be wild and crazy and just be you, and I really don&#39;t want to take that away from you. i just hope that when all is said and done you remember me, we&#39;ll see each other again someday Mckaela, I know it - J</div>                 ')[0];

You&#39;ll probably never read this but I have to get this out &#39;coz I just can&#39;t stop thinking about you. I am a grown woman and nursing a school girl crush on you. It&#39;s almost ridiculous because you probably don&#39;t even like me that way or know that I like you. I don&#39;t even know where to start so I&#39;ll start rambling now. I saw you outside where we work in the parking lot during lunch today and everything I&#39;m trying to repress came bubbling up. First of all, I find you hot :). I don&#39;t agree with your logic, but us arguing during training was cute. I didn&#39;t like you much that day and was even slightly annoyed because you were bashing one of my fav. characters but couple weeks later and onwards, I can&#39;t seem to shake off your logic (I still don&#39;t agree btw) which made me keep thinking of you. Then I realized, you had flashed your biceps when you were training us, but I may be reading waaay too much into this. Somehow, I want the cosmos to tell me that they were signs from you, most likely not! Anyways, I really liked it when we bumped into each other couple weeks ago and had a conversation by your car. I soo didn&#39;t wanna let you go but I don&#39;t know what you may have going on in life and didn&#39;t want to hold you back. I was nervous and caught off-guard so I was too chatty but I yearned to hear you talk. I want to get to know you better and do realize that may never happen. I want to know what else you like, what your interests are, what keeps you going and just gaze into your eyes while you talk to me. I got a good look at your eyes and they are hypnotic, has anyone ever told you that? I get attention from men all the time, but I really want to be noticed by you but don&#39;t know if I&#39;m your type. You don&#39;t seem to be the shy type so if you like me too but are hesitant in any way, hopefully this is going to help and if you do read this, I want you to reach out to me. I&#39;m way too shy in real life (I&#39;m confident too so it may not seem that way) but when I like a guy, I&#39;m never going to show him that I do :( huh! So this is me trying though it may be a very unorthodox and completely useless method. I&#39;ve never done this before (post something on CL!) but I know now that life is very short to have any regrets plus it&#39;s a way to anonymously vent my feelings which are too much for me to contain right now. If you know who I am, in the header tell me my name, your name, where we work and in the body, some details on what we talked about during training and that day after work. Even if you don&#39;t like me the way I do, just acknowledge so I know you read this and so that I can move on. I will never speak of this to anyone so rest assured. Also, I will post this for a while in hopes you&#39;ll someday see it but eventually I&#39;ll give up. Hope you notice it before then :) I know it&#39;s a long post but it doesn&#39;t even begin to describe the way I feel. But if you read the whole post, another good trait about you is your patience and curiosity/likeness for me! -In Major Like With You &amp;lt;3 Others who are still reading my rambling, wish you all best of luck in life :) Plz respect my privacy and don&#39;t respond to this post with any hate mail, it&#39;s a waste of your and my time.</div>                 ')[0];

The original posting I posted that day is below. Thank you. Hi. This is such a long shot. Today (Sunday, July 24, 2016) at the Linda Mar Safeway we saw each other in an isle and we briefly just smiled and said &#34;Hi&#34;. I purposely got in line behind you at check out hoping to talk to you, and you told me that the next checker was available, I said &#34;Thank you&#34;. You left before me and I looked for you in the parking lot. I saw you when you were driving away. You drive a new Volvo T6 SUV. I was so disappointed I didn&#39;t talk to you more. I really wanted to. I noticed you had no wedding ring on so hopefully you are single. I am single too. You were wearing a long blue dress and wedge sandals. I think you look adorable and seem like a nice and beautiful woman. I wanted to ask you out to dinner. I hope you see this and hopefully we can still have dinner some evening. I was wearing a yellow t-shirt. I hope you read this and get back to me.</div>                 ')[0];

They may think that I have moved on, and look happy. I am not. There are many reasons. It isn&#39;t because of one thing that I am so unhappy, it is many. I am also very sick. I had to resort to getting a job, my disability didn&#39;t go through even though it should of. Things are looking not so great for me in the future, but I don&#39;t want you to worry. That isn&#39;t the point of this. The point of this is that I wanted to just see you again. No drama, no games, no bs. Just, two people talking the past through and settling differences. I may seem like a royal bitch at times, and showed you the brunt of it, but I am not one. Really. See, you were around me at a time that was very difficult. I know you knew that, at least I hoped. It has been so long since I spoke to you, I am almost certain you probably hate me. We weren&#39;t the best to each other then, both dealing with alcoholism and other personal things. You aren&#39;t the kind of man that tells your inner parts of your mind to many people. You also have a promise that if you are with someone, you don&#39;t talk to or about the past. It hurts those of us from it, because we can&#39;t figure out what happened. We just gain silence. I understand you don&#39;t want to open that can of worms, I have been there, I was like that too. However, I learned that in life, you can&#39;t keep people that really care away like that. It isn&#39;t about who you are with at the hip. It is about who you give a shit about and who gives a shit. Your spouse is the main one to fall back on, but who do you fall back on when you can&#39;t talk to them? I know the chances are very remote for &#34;healthy&#34; marriages, but even those have &#34;best friends&#34; too. I miss my &#34;best friends&#34; that I used to talk to in order to figure out my life, one more than most. It matters not to me if they are married, I wasn&#39;t in their life to gain the bedsheets from them. I only cared about if they were alive and if they were happy. If I made them happy, great. If I didn&#39;t, great. I only cared about staying in contact and that is what hurt. It was turned on me. You see, not everyone has the same heart as you. That is the one truth I have learned through this. I learned my friends weren&#39;t really my friends in my divorces and mishaps in life. Those that promised they wouldn&#39;t leave, left me cold and near dead in life. Still, some won&#39;t talk. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that they think they are better than me and I embarrass them, or what. I try not to think about how successful I would or could have been by now had I acted on things. I could not do or be what I was demanded to at the time by those that were pushing me. I broke in that my life was pulling me down into an undertow and my friends were trying to lift me. It didn&#39;t work out for all of us the way we wanted. I am sure you all think me dead. I have heard many a rumor I am dead. I also heard I was supposed to have diseases. That latter is true, but not in the way you think. I have cancer. You read that right, yes I do. I had it when I was last around my most special and favorite of best friends. I never told them. You see, I didn&#39;t want them to remember me as this bald, sick, stick of a person they knew. Instead, I chose no surgery, no treatment. Good thing I did, I come to find out that they were wrong. The doctors said I had a cancerous cystic growth. Upon a second opinion, I found myself pregnant. Imagine the whole of my shock. I was given 6 months to live, then BOOM! 6 months later, &#34;Mom.&#34; So, in this update, I need to tell you about another. This &#34;boom&#34; happened recently. I found out I wasn&#39;t eligible for disability, even though I suffer many things that qualify. The problem: not enough evidence in doctors and too big a gap in medical history. Yep, the state was to blame for that. However, I need to sue and that is going to take too long. My &#34;surprise&#34; needed to be cared for and I was sick with a mystery illness. My parents stepped up and tried to help, you can all guess how. They took over for me. They didn&#39;t just &#34;help&#34; me, they &#34;helped&#34; me right out of my rights. It is a sad and far longer story with many more 1 million dollar words than I care to use. For now, I am just leaving this to you. I just wanted you to know I was thinking of you still. Lately, I would have given anything to just talk and have you give me a million dollar hug. You always made me believe when you told me everything was going to be all right. I never was scared. Even though I was terrified of everything and everyone, I believed you. I wish I treated you better. I wish I showed you I appreciated you more. Perhaps we would have... Anyway, This is getting to be a novel and that isn&#39;t the intent. Yes, I am a motormouth in my mind. I can&#39;t help that I am very expressive and have the ability to expound like a library of books. Have a bad childhood like mine and want to run from the bad things in your head, you may be too. The point of this is to really tell you this simple message. I am starting to be human again. I know that is an odd statement, but for me it isn&#39;t. Those that know me, will understand. I am starting work again for the first time in 10 years, and I am scared out of my mind. I could use your pep talks and famous &#34;go get em&#34; speech, but I know it won&#39;t happen. They aren&#39;t for me anymore. You aren&#39;t by my side on my swingset in life anymore. We chose others to be by our sides and mine, well, let&#39;s just say I settled for Mr. Here. He is there for everyone else BUT me. I have been there for him through everything. I am everyone&#39;s rock where I am at in life. It is hardest when I need bubblegum and duct tape. Noone picks me up, dusts me off and throws me to start my skip on the water. I have to. There are no fall backs for me. There are no supports to my tightrope walk in life. Perhaps that is why I failed so epically and never in a small way. I guess I fell off the rope. So, I wanted to tell you I am back up on that rope and still scared of heights. It may look like I am 2 inches off the ground, but to me, I am over a canyon inside of me. I just wish I had you watching and telling me that you are proud of me. I miss that most. I just miss you.. and it hurts that you can&#39;t be there for me and your child like you are her. I know you moved on, and your child is growing well. I just wish you knew of your other. So like you, in many ways. However, we made the deal, the &#34;agreement&#34; wasn&#39;t to look each other up. You thought it failed and another &#34;got me&#34; when they didn&#39;t. I found out at the birth the truth. The doctors were so wrong about everything. From the cancer to the conception date. It was you. I just can&#39;t tell you because we haven&#39;t spoken in that whole of a decade. I am proud of you in all you have done, you have truly left your demons in the past. I see how well you have done for yourself and how well you are in life. I wish your son knew his dad like she knows you. Anyway, I have to go. You are busy with your Late 40s life stuff and I am just starting 40 next year. I think about you all the time. From my mistakes and mishaps to how you would push me. You carried me through everything and for that I wanted to thank you, even if only your memory. I still love you, not the grade school or hallmark card kind, but the real one that lasts forever. Sad that I knew and you left not knowing. You were so angry, and so judgmental. You were hurt. I never judged you as harshly as you did yourself. Much of us was other people and their drama. I just wish we had a real &#34;launch&#34; instead of just a &#34;failure to launch&#34; in life. Take care, ok? I love you... wish me luck in my job.</div>                 ')[0];

She said &#34;Be careful with that one, love He will do what it takes to survive.&#34; You and your words flooded my senses Your sentences left me defenseless You built me palaces out of paragraphs You built cathedrals I&#39;m re-reading the letters you wrote me I&#39;m searching and scanning for answers In every line For some kind of sign And when you were mine The world seemed to Burn Burn You published the letters she wrote you You told the whole world how you brought This girl into our bed In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives Do you know what Angelica said When she read what you&#39;d done? She said &#34;You have married an Icarus He has flown too close to the sun.&#34; You and your words, obsessed with your legacy... Your sentences border on senseless And you are paranoid in every paragraph How they perceive you You, you, you. . . I&#39;m erasing myself from the narrative Let future historians wonder how Eliza Reacted when you broke her heart You have torn it all apart I am watching it Burn Watching it burn The world has no right to my heart The world has no place in our bed They don&#39;t get to know what I said I&#39;m burning the memories Burning the letters that might have redeemed you You forfeit all rights to my heart You forfeit the place in our bed You sleep in your office instead With only the memories Of when you were mine I hope that you burn</div>                 ')[0];

I have posted here before about being sick. I am not a troll. I have family that live in the greater SF bay area as well as friends. I am trying to contact them as I have lost all my contact information through the years. It really isn&#39;t as usual to run into a troll as you would a real person in pain. If you think of the trolls as people that have been hurt, and are confused, that is more the sense. All I can tell you is in the years I have been looking, I have ran across many a person. Two out of hundreds were trolls. Do the math, it isn&#39;t that much of a norm. Many were just people that had similar stories and similarly broken hearts whom wanted to talk. I was blessed in the new friends I acquired while looking for my lost connections. I am grateful for the old and new friends in my life. I am not the normal person either. I have been through hells that you would think belonged on after school specials of what not to do. I should have been on milk boxes and posters, but I never was. That is the only sadness in my life. Don&#39;t get it twisted, I don&#39;t sit and mull over my pain and say, &#34;love me. This haurt me because....&#34; I am NOT that kind of a girl. I didn&#39;t know what curlers were until I did my grandmother&#39;s hair. I still don&#39;t know what color goes with what season or what accessory looks best. Who cares? I have met so many beautiful people that were just as broken hearted as me. Being broken hearted isn&#39;t a stigma or a sickness, it is a phase. Just like learning how to fail. What you take away from your failures is what makes you a person. Take me for instance. Instead of me with a sob story, I will tell you one of how I overcame obstacles and never gave up. Even when others tell me it is hopeless, I stubbornly hang on. Do you know why? I will tell you. When you have nobody, and all you want is a hug, that is the hardest hope to hold on. Just having a hug, and thinking you could receive one, or that you deserved one. Think about that. Just that hope, to be hugged. At one point in time I would have ran like the devil from you for it. I flat out refused any touching a long time ago because of how I felt about my skin and myself. I wouldn&#39;t even let my family near me, it hurt to touch them. I felt hollow and like I was missing. I didn&#39;t understand it then, but I do now. The term is called &#34;Numbing out&#34; and you just are blah. You withdraw and pull away and tend to just, exist. It isn&#39;t a life, it isn&#39;t even living, your&#39;re just there. I wouldn&#39;t wish that upon my worst enemy. I mean that, they don&#39;t even deserve to know &#34;alone.&#34; When you are truly alone, you learn alot about yourself. So, some may be still learning. Thus, the troll is born. They are hurting, and they want to be acknowledged. Or, they are bored. Either way, they want to be acknowledged and told they matter, even if only for a moment. You would be amazed at how it would change things if you just spoke for a moment. To tell someone in pain that you understand they are in pain, can see it and told them they aren&#39;t alone. That, to some, saves lives. So, if you see someone talking about not much time left, treat them fair. You have no idea whether the truth is on the other side of that screen. It may just be, like I am. However, don&#39;t be so gullible to think everyone has the same heart as you. They don&#39;t. Don&#39;t blindly trust that everything you read is what is the truth. Unlike me, some have other motives. My motive is simple. To save pain. Be it the one that feels they need to bully to be heard, or the one that is a victim that screams and wants to just know they exist, or the one that is lonely. Pain has no boundary, no preference, and no emotional bearing on sparing you. It just is. Just as life just is. It is what you put into it. That is the lesson I learned, the very hard way. Sometimes, you put so much of yourself out there, nothing is left for you. That is why the &#34;empty.&#34; You must leave yourself a boundary and say, &#34;This is just for me, for my 5 mintutes.&#34; That is the &#34;healthy&#34; way. Remember that not all show things the same, and need to be learned. There is no one way to live life, grieve death, or remember a friend that we lost track of or lost. In that, everyone is right and has the ability to be equal. So, start by recognizing what is similar. Start there, then go to what is different. That is a way to break the ice and save lives. Like I said, pain is universal, like hunger, birth, death, and growth. Willing or unwilling, it happens. So, you may as well embrace it for what it is and take away what you can learn from it. Don&#39;t suffer through it, learn from it and tell yourself, &#34;at least I survived a bad day and stayed sane.&#34; Literally, if that is all you did, great. It is a success because it could be SO much worse. Keep grounded on that and you will see your life not quite such a misery.</div>                 ')[0];

I am an Arab-American friend male(about 5&#39;8, medium build and dark skin)and we talked a lot over the phone. I always debated Middle Eastern politics(that&#39;s how we met). I remember her telling me that she had a sister and her parents(if I remember correctly)lived in Santa Rosa. I missed our conversations and how we comforted each other through our college life. We talked about becoming more than friends at times, but didn&#39;t want to ruin our friendship. I graduated in 98 and don&#39;t know when or if Dara graduated. If Dara reads this, please contact me through the Craigslist link above. If you knew Dara, please contact me and provide me contact information and her last name, so I can find her. Dara, I just want to talk. I hope you are well. For the past week or so, I have been really missing our friendship. Please contact me.</div>                 ')[0];

When I see a beautiful sexy women I dream, I imagine things, more likely imagine positions, sex, her body or just imagine being with her. Yes, I am delusional, what the heck.. I am always horny, especially when I exercise, days later I am horny and masturbating. I am like a volcano, erupting or boiling water, horny and eager. But yet as the dreamer I am the women I enjoy to watch or look, quite frankly all the time stare away... yes that is me, that guy who sits from a distance, hiding his real horny self for an opportunity of a possible conversation. What em I.. .. I have these disturbing thoughts, always thinking sex or wanting to have sex with someone I see. When I am bored, I masturbate. In Los Gatos there are a lot of beautiful women, but only if they too would be like me, eager, horny, willing to do it.. yeah like me.</div>                 ')[0];

You call me supposedly because you were concerned about my emotional state. Seemed oddly coincidental with my being by the boardwalk especially since you sounded like you were at a/the boardwalk to (or a Dave and Busters) during this call you tell me you are not seeing anyone and can&#39;t imagine being ready for some time. That you are in Sunnyvale (do they have a boardwalk) and you admonish me and browbeat me about having lost trust in me (because I didn&#39;t keep your secrets). But in fact, you have had a boy for some time, so long in fact that when you made it seem like I dumped you, you were openly seen with him w/o concern. You weren&#39;t in Sunnyvale but were (much to my great disgust and further erosion of any remaining respect for your parentage) in Santa Cruz having dinner with the &#39;rents and the new guy. This only a month after moving out of my place where you loved for over 1 year, never paying bill 1 and doing shit all around the apartment. And I presume since you thought I would kill something when I found out what you had been doing behind my back you file for a restraining order so as to keep me away and you will be less that 1 mile away? Are you fucking daft? Is he insane? Can you imagine the stress you will endure? I can, because I have with all of your co-workers and so called friends giving me the stink eye and my &#34;thinking&#34; I see you but know it can&#39;t be you since you live in San Jose. You youngsters might want to get a grip and consider a few things namely how you want to live your lives.

I used to come to your apartment, and although I was straight I did not care that your gay roommates were home. We would fuck. I was still young and naive, we fucked raw and felt so right. I remember the first time we met you just finished showering and were wearing a jean skirt. I took you right there. You even picked me up from my place when my girlfriend left, we went to your place and you sucked my cock for so long, looking up at me. We tried to fit your fat cock into my virgin ass but it could not fit and I jumped off in pain. You had photos of yourself up on your wall, I met your white cat, you told me stories about the hardships of being a tranny in the streets. I want to worship your cock! I want to kiss you again. Your old email address was sftgsensation at america on line dot com. This email has since been discontinued. I was six foot, white, tattoos on my arms. Brown hair, green eyes. I want to reconnect!

I was getting ready to leave, using mouthwash in the area near the bathroom, and you returned from your massage. I asked you how it went and used the long-form of your name. You told me how it went, and we introduced ourselves, you giving the diminutive form of your name. Then we went back to the locker area, and you came over and offered to give me a massage in the steam room.

You: about 6 feet tall, built/athletic with dark blond/light brown short wavy hair, glasses, bright red tshirt and tight blue gym/swim shorts that didn&#39;t hide much - and your butt definitely stole the show (legs a close second). You&#39;re in your mid/late 20s, white, and we crossed paths in the banana section (how fitting lol). We made eye contact and the gaze was held a little longer than usual. Maybe I just have a creepy face and you were caught off guard by it? I had the day off and am glad I went to the market when I did, even to just see someone like you. I wanted to say hi but was with someone so I pretended to be busy with my phone while still side eyeing you. I&#39;m Asian, mid 20s, a little shorter than you, also wear glasses, and was wearing a black tshirt with a specific pattern on the back. Perhaps it&#39;s the weather that&#39;s making me find anyone wearing form fitting clothes that much more attractive. But I figured if I don&#39;t at least try, there&#39;s no chance :)</div>                 ')[0];

You held my gaze for a moment and then smiled at me. A beautiful, easy smile that would brighten my darkest mood. Your group was leaving just as I continued past.

Our eyes met and we equally lite up with big warm smiles for each other, as if we knew each other, missed each other, so happy to see each other. I felt something for you instantly. I believe you did too. This never happens to me. I was a little shy and a little out going. I had what in my hand? I was jovial from a good day of golf and an extended happy hour experience moments earlier. We walked on in separate directions. Shorty you returned to the parking lot. As you had discovered the Nantucket was closed. We waved and smiled at each other. I wanted to introduce myself and give you my business card. But I was too shy. Heart in hand I was watching you and you me as you drove away the passenger in that very black, very special car. I will know it is you and or you will know it is me because we both know the make and model. I had on a teal colored tee shirt and green work pants. You had on a turquoise to green tee shirt on and a denim not sure of the color skirt. Maybe you will see this and contact me so we can meet and find out what all the warm smiles are about.</div>                 ')[0];

I was too shy to respond to your original smile &amp; also when you looked back (despite my maturity of years). I have regretted not communicating with you at that time ever since. You are tall &amp;amp; slender, were wearing shapely blue jeans to match your exquisite figure &amp;amp; knee high brown/tan boots. Shoulder length hair.

We could have been so happy together... We were so happy together, and I just wanted more. And then I tried to talk to you about it, instead of acting on it, which I know now was the wrong way to get you. It just felt so irresponsible to just go for it in a &#34;moment&#34; (of which I personally felt many)... I valued and respected you too much to do it... I didn&#39;t want to be just another guy trying to get in your pants. Ironic that that&#39;s probably how it looked in the end. Just like you told me you didn&#39;t want to be another women to reject me... Ironic indeed. Honestly, I&#39;m not even sure I want &#34;more&#34; anymore... but god damn I miss what we had. It&#39;s crazy how often a still think of you... many times a day, some days. The worst is how easily it seems you&#39;ve moved on... Did I ever matter to you, or was I just another &#34;mister&#34;? I try to act like I&#39;ve moved on when I see you. Most the time I avoid you now because it still hurts so much. Asking me to taxi you and that guy, who you&#39;d just met/made out with, back to your house is probably the most hurtful and insensitive things anyone, man or woman, has ever done to me. So much pain, and some anger, but still, all it would take to be friends again is a simple apology. Even a silent apology; just a heartfelt hug and &#34;I love you&#34; from you. -Mr. Man</div>                 ')[0];

I asked what your favorite sandwich was and you said the nova lox. I asked, &#34;is that the one with the capers and red onions?&#34; And you replied, &#34;yeah, but I get it with the cucumbers and without the capers or red onions.&#34; And i laughed and said &#34;i&#39;m the opposite, i get it without the cucumbers and with the capers and red onions.&#34; You are the blonde cutie, and I just found your tinder profile. I guess you go to sonoma state meaning you might be here only for the summer. I&#39;d love to take you to a movie and have a drink after. We met monday at your work. I&#39;m the skinny guy with the long hair, it was in a little manbun when we met (monday), i think i came in around 2? I had grey gym shorts on, grey toms, a blue shirt with a red motorcycle on it, a vivofit on my wrist? When i left we made eye contact just as i entered my car. My name is Tyler and you&#39;re Carly. I hope it&#39;s not lame that I mention your name on here. Oh, and you were completing your co-workers drawing when I left. Hopefully you see this. The modern message in a bottle, this missed connections thing. Love reading through them.</div>                 ')[0];

You were always with several people and I thought it would be awkward, however in hindsight it was much less awkward than this... One time it was late (about 2 years ago) and I was working in the Starbucks. You came back from what I believe was happy hour since you seemed pretty drunk. You seemed to be waiting for someone. down there. I was there with a coworker (Indian girl) sitting at one of the 3 tall tables but once again was too chicken to say anything, even though I wanted to. Anyhow, they closed down my floor in March and I haven&#39;t returned to the building since. You have dark hair and above average height. I would guess in your mid 20&#39;s. Ki**ko tried to help me out but the timing never worked out. Me, I work in tech and spent my daytime with tech folk. I used to come downstairs with a short asian guy usually. I wore hoodies and a t-shirt almost every day. Anyway, I&#39;m sure the chances of this working are worse than winning Powerball, but what the hell. :) If you read this, please respond with your name.</div>                 ')[0];

Not going to lie i did yell out ORINDA while walking through the camp just on the off chance you were around. no luck with that. had to much energy and need to do something so off to the slient disco. There you were again miley cryus sweater and all. I laughed because i forgot you were going to wear it later. dance dance and danced away. but in the end didnt ever ask you for your number. the regret is freal. you were too fly dancing your night away and would love to go dance with you before you leave.

You brought it BAAACK!:  	Dear Whoever Stole My Beat-Ass Red Honda Civic; O frabjous day! Calloo cullay! My car has been returned! At two in the morning, less than 24 hours after I noticed that you had absconded with my much-loved but thoroughly beat-ass car for whatever purposes you may have had, I got a call. My car! I was delighted to hear that you&#39;d left my car in a safe but glaringly obvious place, and I raced over and reclaimed my baby. Thank you so much for leaving her out for me. And thank you for fixing her up! Incredibly enough, she&#39;s in slightly better shape than I left her - you reinforced the front bumper that was hanging by a thread, and even fixed the rattling gearshift! Perhaps you were planning to keep her until the engine started smoking. If you had asked to borrow her I could have warned you that she ran hot and had a radiator leak, but ah well, such is life. She&#39;s at the family mechanic now, getting some tlc and resting up after her wild adventure in the big city. As far as I&#39;m concerned this wasn&#39;t even a theft - it was a sudden loan, a do-it-yourself uber of sorts. All the police I&#39;ve spoken to have told me that this is crazy stupid common in SF; apparently, when people want to do something, shall we say, less than scrupulous, they just steal a car for it rather than dick with parking. I must confess, if I was determined to do something less than scrupulous, this is probably how I&#39;d do it. So whatever sort of shenanigans and/or monkeyshines you needed a car for, I hope they went well. In the trunk there was a heavy-duty battery charger, which is now gone. Enjoy it with my blessings; I got many good years outta that thing. There&#39;s an air compressor in the back! You also kept the crocheted poncho in the back seat, which my mother made. She&#39;s making me a new one; may the old one keep you warm. Also, you used a whole tank of gas, but you also left a pretty nice pair of speakers, so I&#39;d say we&#39;re square. Again, thank you so much for returning my car. My baby, my lifeline, my decrepit darling. Whoever you are, best of luck to you in all your endeavors. Warmest Regards, Your New Clunker Buddy</div>                 ')[0];

If all of the leaves were brassy and orange and brown. If the cement was always wet, and I could hear the small twigs snapping beneath my boots. There might be oversized sweaters involved. Mugs brimming with hot chocolate or apple cider. Savory confections that warm me from the inside out. I want to get my hands on a pumpkin again. To listen to its satisfying hollow resonance. I want to bake pumpkin seeds and pumpkin cheesecake. I long for crisp, cool air. The scent of damp earth after it rains. I want to feel the drops on my upturned palms. I want to be drenched in it. To peel off my saturated clothing and slip into a warm bath. I want to listen to the hiss of a downpour through an open window. The pleasant tapping against tin gutters and clay tile. I want to wake up to it, again. Instead, it&#39;s still too hot... and you&#39;re still gone. There is nothing to comfort me. It sounds so lazy when I say it that way. Would I feel better to set off randomly into the heart of San Francisco? Wander its sloping streets in accordance with the direction of my heart. Where would it take me, I wonder... Would I happen upon you, somewhere? Would I be better for it? I only want for you to know that I won&#39;t delight in forgetting you.

Xxl t-shirt and torn, baggy capris paired with funky tennis shoes and men&#39;s socks. No make-up, hair pulled into an artless pony tail. You: Younger. Sporting better coordinated workout clothes. I didn&#39;t note a lot of details. You held the door open for me and I thanked you. You walked in another direction but you continued to look at me for a bit. I cringed a little inside. I don&#39;t fit into the expected categories one assigns to citizens of the world and I&#39;ve gotten stares for most of my life. Often, usually, I am fine with that. Today I felt ugly. Bulky in my broad shoulders, muscle and bone poking through my ratty tshirt. Not thin enough today to feel my hipbones with the sides of my arms or display good bone structure, I was feeling awkward. Hunched a bit. Trying to fade. When we were almost too far to be heard, you said, &#34;You&#39;re beautiful by the way.&#34; And you kept walking. I responded with a sincere thank you. And I walked up to the weight lifting class and I felt the strength in my legs and I felt the power in my soul from all the battles I&#39;ve survived and I felt the kindness inside that I hope comes through and touches those around me and I felt ok today. I watched myself lift in the mirror and I saw the definition in my calves not as manly but as a form of beauty. Thank you. I know that it is a risk to compliment a woman and that some would call this very exchange harassment. I&#39;m quite the feminist, and I&#39;m happy to say that I didn&#39;t feel at all threatened or demeaned by your compliment. I&#39;m glad such things can exist.</div>                 ')[0];

I was stupidly in love with a woman who thinks she knows what love is. You left me the same way you left your ex husband... only thinking of yourself and about the money and your own selfish greed. You could never grasp in your heart how much hurt and anguish you cause your family and those that love you. Even your children see this and will always carry your anguish with them. I was there to help and even with your false promises and cheating I was there for you (stupidly). You&#39;ll seem like a worthy woman in need and the men will be there until your true self is exposed again and again. You said you want to be alone and get involved with man after man but cannot trust or love again. You played with my broken emotions for two months after you cheated on me. Then broke my new relationship up with your crying phone calls and stalking in the middle of the night. If that wasn&#39;t enough for you, you had me pay for you for a world vacation for you to break up with me and totally destroy my heart forever. When I tried to speak with you all you could say was, &#34;get over it&#34; and there wasn&#39;t any remorse or heart. It&#39;s sad that you think you were right all along. I hope someone will have as much pitty on you as I did and love you but it&#39;s sad you will never have the capability to provide another forever love.

This time though - it was wonderful to share a conversation - relaxing and talking about a variety of things which helped me relax And in a relaxed state my mind was left to wander - and for the first time I was thinking of not behaving like the gentleman I was brought up to be... I found myself trying to think of ways to catch your attention in a &#34;not so platonic way&#34; - but short of standing up, walking over, and bending down to kiss you, I wasn&#39;t able to come up with anything. And fortunately, or unfortunately depending on your thoughts, I was both too much of a gentleman and too scared, to take that kind of step. I almost suggested that you looked tense and could use a backrub - but again, that would have been a bit too forward. I even went so far as to leave my door slightly ajar, hoping you would come by and check on me and take the first step But alas, I was left to myself and my dreams... If you want to hear more about my dreams - let me know - just change the subject in your e-mail response to either the company I work for or the name of my side business. Probably nothing will happen - but one never knows</div>                 ')[0];

I know this relationship had an expiration date from the moment we began it. But as the time got closer, I didn&#39;t want it to end. But we ended it still. Now that I&#39;m back, you want to keep things casual. I agreed. But do you see how much it kills me? How much it kills me that you only want to keep things casual with me? You tell me how much you missed me... You tell me how much I mean to you... You tell me all this romantic stuff- how is it casual? I agreed because I am young and stupid. I agreed because I missed you terribly.. But it kills me that you don&#39;t want something more. It kills me that those months were nothing to you. And don&#39;t tell me that you care, or they did mean something to you. Because if they did, and if you cared, you would have more respect for me and our time spent, than to continue this. I am giving you a chance here... I am giving us a chance... But I am begining to realize you don&#39;t want it.. you might not even deserve it. Not anymore at least. Eventually I will move on. There are other fish in the sea; I learned that while I was gone. And eventually I will become the one that got away. And by that time, it will be too late. If you feel like the way you feel, but don&#39;t act upon, then you can&#39;t expect me to stay forever in this rut. I wish you wanted me, like the way I want you. This is truely, a missed connection.. -BC</div>                 ')[0];

We continued flirty eye contact all the way out the door with multiple lookings over my shoulder to see him continuing the eye contact. Was very obvious and sexy/ fun! I walked out the cafe and continued walking with my friend as I needed to go back to my place. I got back to the cafe 30 minutes later hoping I&#39;d see him there, but alas he was no longer there!

I believe we live on the same block, but on opposite sides of the street, very near there. We started chatting while waiting for the streetcar. I was headed to have dinner with a friend at 16th &amp; Valencia. When someone came walking up from the direction of Dolores Park and told us that there was an issue in that direction, I decided to drive. Since your destination was only a couple of blocks further (14th &amp;amp; Valencia), I offered you a ride...which you accepted. We had a nice chat while driving. I have been hoping that I would bump into you again in the intervening 2 weeks, but alas, I have not. With luck, you will find this post and reply or perhaps even leave a note on my vehicle (I hope you remember which it was, I am often parked in front of my home).

Someone or a group who needs the right connection, love and understanding. This need often takes on different faces and disguises and can easily blend into the crowd or the mass. This ability to disguise is in large part do to all of our individual demands and stresses, These are very true and very valid. What I hope is that we as a collective can start to feel for others. I hope that we can slow down just a bit and detach to see the meaning of others and respect that their path may be different than ours. I think we all can agree that life is short and time seems to go by pretty fast. Im not asking to inconvenience anyone but rather just think and feel about others around us. We may live separately and drive separate cars but energetically we are all so very connected. do you have to save everyone? Of course not but try to have compassion in your heart the next time you see struggle or heart ache. We are all unique and blessed wit different strengths and weaknesses. As a result some people do better and even thrive in the current environment and societal standards. That is wonderful. Everyone should thrive but as nature would have it some people are different any may have strengths that are not recognized by the day to day en devour. I know how cheesy and ridiculous all of this sounds but i think it important to entertain the idea that maybe the individual who doesn&#39;t live in the four thousand square foot house may have an equal amount to contribute as the the person who smells bad and looks funny. I know its crazy but I think there is always more to the story. So please I hope you all continue to thrive as well as lean over and acknowledge a brother or sister and let them know that there is hope and that they are appreciated too. That they are different from you but that you know that they are human too and that we all make this life and world together. We can all appreciate beauty together and know that challenges are hard and taxing but they all can be overcome. Anyone is capable of anything. That is beauty of tomorrow. We all get to have it and we all aren&#39;t quite sure what that day is to bring. Sp try it. Try it for even a brief moment today and try to open your heart to understanding and watch how you are rewarded. There is energy waiting to be channeled and I promise that energy will be felt....... do NOT contact me with unsolicite</div>                 ')[0];

Someone or a group who needs the right connection, love and understanding. This need often takes on different faces and disguises and can easily blend into the crowd or the mass. This ability to disguise is in large part do to all of our individual demands and stresses, These are very true and very valid. What I hope is that we as a collective can start to feel for others. I hope that we can slow down just a bit and detach to see the meaning of others and respect that their path may be different than ours. I think we all can agree that life is short and time seems to go by pretty fast. Im not asking to inconvenience anyone but rather just think and feel about others around us. We may live separately and drive separate cars but energetically we are all so very connected. do you have to save everyone? Of course not but try to have compassion in your heart the next time you see struggle or heart ache. We are all unique and blessed wit different strengths and weaknesses. As a result some people do better and even thrive in the current environment and societal standards. That is wonderful. Everyone should thrive but as nature would have it some people are different any may have strengths that are not recognized by the day to day en devour. I know how cheesy and ridiculous all of this sounds but i think it important to entertain the idea that maybe the individual who doesn&#39;t live in the four thousand square foot house may have an equal amount to contribute as the the person who smells bad and looks funny. I know its crazy but I think there is always more to the story. So please I hope you all continue to thrive as well as lean over and acknowledge a brother or sister and let them know that there is hope and that they are appreciated too. That they are different from you but that you know that they are human too and that we all make this life and world together. We can all appreciate beauty together and know that challenges are hard and taxing but they all can be overcome. Anyone is capable of anything. That is beauty of tomorrow. We all get to have it and we all aren&#39;t quite sure what that day is to bring. Sp try it. Try it for even a brief moment today and try to open your heart to understanding and watch how you are rewarded. There is energy waiting to be channeled and I promise that energy will be felt.......</div>                 ')[0];

You were really funny and I was kind of digging your vibe. I wanted to ask for your number since you were incredibly outgoing but I&#39;m a huge dork. The thing that most stuck out in my head was when you were telling us about when you started being sexually active and your mom made a comment about it, so you sassed her saying something like &#34;I&#39;m going to get all the STDs&#34;. My friend made the &#34;Gotta Catch Them All&#34; comment and we all shared a nice laugh. You had an eyebrow piercing and two green plugs in both of your ears. I think you lost two out of four of them by the end of the night. I was pretty tipsy so I was probably a little handsy and loud around you. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever find this, but if you did, we should totally go out for a drink some time.</div>                 ')[0];

Actually, I know the first 3 letters, if thats your name. I think you were on tinder for one day. I saw your profile, but wanted to talk to you in person so i didnt swipe till a day and half later, your profile there on my phone the whole time, since thats how tinder works not resetting till the profile brought up is swiped one way or another. When i did swipe, nothing happened. I realize I didnt at least catch your whole name so I googled how to sort of reset tinder the account so that everything is deleted and it starts all over again. I did that, but your profile never came back up, so it looks like you just tried it and got freaked out about it and deleted the acct. We talked a couple of times, with the last a bit awkward, perhaps because you just thought i was motivated by tinder as opposed to just having seen you across in a cafe.</div>                 ')[0];

Edit . 2nd edit:  	Starting w/ what most people would consider the negative. Don&#39;t care if you&#39;re into rejecting. Like I said, I like being alone. Seriously. Part of it is introversion. Another part is I have things that I haven&#39; t completed yet&amp; being that life is never a guarantee, nothing can truly wait until tomorrow. Although, rest is a necessity every day To the people that refuse to read,or that can*not* read, I get at minimum 7 to 7.5 hours of sleep EVERY night. I NEVER use illegal drugs,and do NOT use legal drugs,recreationally. Sending me email after email calling me sl*t, wh*re,bipolar,schizo.psych*,or any other lame thing shows YOUR true colors, and proves you&#39;re a coward and a bully. Btw, imho, you deserve to get reported to the medical board, and, corrupt law enforcement for masquerading as a psychiatrist &amp;amp; or psychologist. Furthermore, you obviously have no friends and no life Other than that, to the person that sent a name they thought I might be, apologies, I&#39;m not that person. All others, my apologies that I don&#39;t have the time to respond to each individual. As you can tell,after sleep, the analytical me has returned. The original post was intended to ferret out the person or people behind the queen withholding, done etc posts, centered around Durant and college. For the person that inquired, I&#39;m &#34;past my prime&#34; ,and quite comfortable in my own skin Additionally, I am usually a night owl Edit ; A person claiming to be the op sent an email. Interesting what his occupation appears to be. Leaving this up to let people know there are women out there like myself ; that will call out bullies, know that we&#39;re introverts, love our sleep,think for ourselves, and don&#39;t care if you are into rejecting , because we&#39;re *not* looking &amp;amp; *not* into being chased,or chasing. Moreover, there are women who don&#39;t &#34;find their voices&#34; until later in life, and that take a little longer to finalize the direction they want their lives to go in 9 p.m For the record,if the so called op is who he seems to be_, he has ties to UcB, and Harvard &amp;amp; very likely to mrb G.W.H &amp;amp; A** / A*** K*******n Aug 16 update below : To the person , on the 15th claiming to be a woman,going from calm,cool,and collected to extremely nasty within the span of three hours - half laughing, and half don&#39;t care. For everyones information, pretty sure it&#39;s the entire mrb gang,taking turns responding. Not being conceited, at all. It&#39;s called confidence, and it comes with age, and experience. And because it&#39;s obvious that you all are obsessed with what I do, I spent the last five days dealing with gadgets,and researching the possibility of getting a new gadget ( 10 hours on that part). From 6 to 7 on the 15th, I spent my time discussing all things medical &amp;amp; gadgets with a platonic male friend of 7 years. After that, went to 3 different grocery stores,and a 4th store,where I picked up a new &#34;toy&#34; that is *not* sex related, and will provide me with all kinds of amusement for months,and hopefully, more than a year</div>                 ')[0];

The sun so radiant, he burns so bright. The moon so luminous, but only showed her face during the night. She was untouchable, surrounding herself with a blanket of darkness. The sun would give anything to catch a glimpse of the Moon illuminating the beautiful night sky. Until one day when the Sun was sliding out of the heavens, he caught a glimpse of her. She was peeking up, a rare side of her being exposed to the light. And while the Sun could shine, he knew the Moon could glow. Just as the Stars were wandering into the night, the Sun fell in love like a snowball hurding down a mountain. How he wished to see her move than the fleeting moments he shared with her at both dawn and dusk. But they were a world apart. &#34;Go,&#34; she whispered to him one of those nights, her voice as sweet and sorrowful as the last light of morning. &#34;Go and let me breathe, for you and I have decided fates. You illuminate the day, and I cast a glow one the night. We will never be. Our connection would go against what all the people believe, all they know&#34; During the summer he would stay a little longer just in case she would change his mind. It was no use. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare abandon your blessing of light for my darkness.&#34; And those were the last words the Moon was strong enough to speak to the Sun. The Sun could feel her peaceful soul and it soon became clear. He would die each and every night to let his true love breathe, for it would put an end to all her misery. &#34; a tale like this should be heard and seen.&#34; &#34;And no one will know it is the story of you and me.&#34;</div>                 ')[0];
