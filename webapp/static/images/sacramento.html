I can&#39;t spell. Why can&#39;t someone fall for me the way that I fall for them? Why can&#39;t someone fall for me at all? Why is it that every time I feel like I&#39;m on top of the world it gets destroyed so quickly? Taken away and replaced with this feeling I hate so much. Why did god choose me to be a puppet? Someone damned to be alone. Always thinking I found what everyone is looking for. And don&#39;t give me that BULL SHIT that I&#39;ll find it when I&#39;m not looking for it because if I&#39;m not looking for it I&#39;m not getting it. Because if I&#39;m not looking for it I don&#39;t want it. You make yourself sound stupid as fuck when you say if you stop looking for it you&#39;ll find it. Why is it so hard for me? Why am I stuck feeling so fucking alone? What makes me so different that I don&#39;t get the one thing everyone is here for? What&#39;s so wrong with me that no one wants me? With every scar on my heart it gets further and further from being possible. Every time I get rejected it destroys my confidence more and more in a way that not even time can heal. If it could it would have happened by now. People tell me to lower my standards and all I can think is if I lower them anymore I wouldn&#39;t be attracted to who I end up with. That would make it fake. Could you imagine someone telling you your attractive if your not attractive to them. That&#39;s a lie. There goes trust. So no I won&#39;t lower my fucking standards. I&#39;m this way for a reason. Go ahead and say it. &#34;Your choosing the wrong women&#34; as if that&#39;s not an insulting statement to tell someone they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re attracted to and people know how to pretend to be just that. So fuck you if you think I&#39;m choosing the wrong women. It&#39;s not my fault they played the roll. And fuck you if you plan on telling me to keep trying because I&#39;m already going to dip shit, not everyone is mental to answer such a complex question and I never even wanted an answer. I was asking because I&#39;m hurt and don&#39;t have anyone to talk to about how I feel that will listen and keep they&#39;re mouth shut so I can get it all off of my chest. They all chime in as soon as you take a second to gather your thoughts. I have feelings too. I can&#39;t just keep them locked away anymore. It&#39;s much worse on me and the public. I hurt people when I can&#39;t vent how I feel. Why can&#39;t people just listen to it and not try to turn into a professional about it. Sure I&#39;m not innocent but I know what I&#39;m talking about when I give people advice and they almost always walk away smarter happier and with a better understanding of they&#39;re situation. I speak from experience. Most of the people I know don&#39;t know how it is to never have had someone stick around for more than a year. Facebook isn&#39;t sticking around. No I won&#39;t settle for less than what I deserve. I won&#39;t put someone through that and won&#39;t let someone use me because I SOUND so desperate. I&#39;m not desperate. I&#39;m tired. I just want the search to be over. I want a good woman to come my way that isn&#39;t fucked up, isn&#39;t controlling, isn&#39;t just trying to use me for what I have, doesn&#39;t need me to get by. One that&#39;s attracted to me that I&#39;m attracted to. That&#39;s real. Not all the bullshit that I&#39;ve had. I&#39;ve met one too. But she hates me for no reason. Just because I fell for her. I didn&#39;t press the issue or get wired about it. I just told her one time how I feel. Then she thought I was doing trying to get with her and cut all contact. It feels like I found exactly what I&#39;m looking for and she doesn&#39;t give a shot if I live or die. I&#39;m hurt. I just want it to stop. No one should be hurt as much as me. For the record last time I spoke of being hurt. When I killed myself. That woman hurt me plenty of times for almost a year. It wasn&#39;t different women hurting me so fuck you if you think I&#39;m that naive. Go ahead and laugh with your friends about how I fall for a different women every week because that&#39;s not true or even close. It was all the same one. But you didn&#39;t know that because your too careless to ask. Sure I&#39;ve had women piss me off but the painful posts like this one are usually because I spent enough time with a woman to know I had feelings for her. The problem is usually that I spoke too soon or too late. So they say. You don&#39;t know how hard it is to be me. I do love myself until something like this makes me think I&#39;m repulsive. I don&#39;t care to fit in. I want to connect. With one woman. But they all know they can have what ever they want so why accept me. I&#39;m nothing. Thank god if my spelling didn&#39;t let you make it this far.</div>                 ')[0];

It blind sided me. For three months I was in a drunken haze but still living my life. I had no idea that you would return to me only to leave me again. I met your family and they were impressed with me. I spent time with you and cared for you. Was I not strong enough? Was I not enough of a piece of shit like the men you prefer to sleep with? Was that it? You made me weak during our relationship. You came crawling back to me and I let you in again. Only once I let my guard down, you took off after telling you me wouldn&#39;t. After I finally cracked and told you I loved you. You left me in the rain like a fool. When you left you took everything I had. My dignity, my respect, any bit of strength I had left in me. You took it all away so you can continue to sleep around and use men. It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve seen your face but I look at your picture almost every night. My mind replays the sound of your voice. I have no escape no matter what I try. I&#39;ve given up on dating. I&#39;ve continued to peruse my career and keep making more money doing that. After all, that&#39;s all that mattered to you, isn&#39;t it? You didn&#39;t want to be the bread winner. I never asked you for money. I always surprised you with gifts, even if I had to secretly go without. You continue to wear me down despite having not seen you in six months. All that&#39;s left is a bitter old man in the body of a 27 year old. I want you to know something. You continue to sleep around with men who may be taller, in better shape, or have more money than I; but none of them will ever make you cum like I did. Your soaking wet sheets are proof of that. After all, when you came crawling back, your &#34;drunk confession&#34; was obvious you missed it. You didn&#39;t miss me, you missed what I did to you. I fell for it all. Even the allure of an instant family was there. I never knew that&#39;s what I wanted until I had it. Now it&#39;s all gone. Every bit. Don&#39;t cry for me because I&#39;m already dead.</div>                 ')[0];

As they were working a lot I kept her company with small talk and t.v. just passing the time. One night she asked if she could&#34;spend the night&#34; in my part of the house. Confused I agreed and what started innocently became gentle soft and tender love making through the darkness of the night. She spent most of the rest of her visit with me. Though a relative stranger our souls connected in that week. 25 years later I still think of her , I have no regrets and consider myself lucky to have shared that time with her. Susan, thank you.
