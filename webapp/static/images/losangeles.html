You contacted me in all kinds of convoluted ways once every six months until I found you on CL in 2011 posting anonymously. I was intrigued as I assumed you were someone else and broke up with P****** after an 8 year relationship but when I determined who you were I was pissed off and went off the deep end because as I mentioned before, you&#39;re a total nutcase.

I stood where the biker passengers usually stand with their bikes. I didn&#39;t notice you until I found an open seat. you were sitting on the seat that have priority for the elderly and disabled. That&#39;s when I saw your fiery red hair. At first I wasn&#39;t paying attention but I noticed that our eyes made contacted. You started blushing and tried to hide your face, it was very cute. You wore classes, had thick-full red hair. Also were wearing a pair of scrubs and converse-style sneaks no laces. As riders boarded the train to north hollywood I noticed you trying to get a glimpse of me. I was too shy to say anything and it&#39;s my deepest regret not saying anything as you tried to reach out to me. You then went up the escalator out towards vermont/sunset never to see you again.

You had black sweats on, and there was something very sexy about you. I was driving a black Prius. As I pulled around the parking lot to pull out you were putting your cart back, and we both caught one another making eye contact. We both stared back at one another as you were in your car and I was pulling out onto Figueroa. We both smiled and waived at one another as I turned onto the road and drove off. You were very sexy, and I was trying not to stare at your curves. I thought by some wild chance that maybe you might look on here? I was 5&#39;11&#34; and have wavy/curly brownish hair.</div>                 ')[0];

Brewing up trouble with you, each on angling for a piece of you Two I knew were S and J, one was me and the last was you A. Although you know about the blood stain that won&#39;t leave. Although I hadn&#39;t killed anyone until those ghost of you Came rapping on the washroom stall with their gossip In the blackest nigh the fog of intertwined body parts remained. But I was disappointed, merely sad, merely embarrassed Rose cheeked and rose haired, it took a turn for the worse When you left for Vancouver. How could you let them poison me. How could you let them cloud my mind with their debauchery. And the noble crusade belongs to Hamlet at last. You don&#39;t expect me to believe that you weren&#39;t at their party. Having fun without me, batting your long powder lashes. Not crippled and simple like me, weighted with this weight. I picked up the knife and asked for permission You gave me your blessing. And everything became my fault. But when I looked in your eyes you&#39;d changed. Like the evil demon that lived in me Had taken possession, black in your eyes With a mirthless laughter. My obsession could not be saved. Nothing is original not even the original sin. That&#39;s all I have to confess this time. You ask about the love, is it lost has it been found. It has been eroded by desert sand and it&#39;s Crystalizing into a new sun somewhere in the Heart of the universe where old souls go. Every tooth in a zipper fitting together. These teeth of my very bite clasped in anticipation. That&#39;s where loved nests, between jagged crags. Soft as down and sweetgrass and as potent as Ash to a phoenix. I just need to hit that violent alarm. Snooze. [where] Allow you to find her. And quit this crazy witch hunt. &#34;Clean me off I&#39;m so dirty baby.&#34; Notes/References: Megadeth - Endgame, Megadeth - Skin Of My Teeth, Megadeth - Trust PS: How fucking irritated are you, how much in your face am I?</div>                 ')[0];

I once knew a boy with beautiful bedroom eyes. He was a trekkie, loved ALF and Final Fantasy. Had a major hard-on for Morrissey and Depeche Mode. We fucked on his Mothers bed, once. I think I started my period during that particular escapade. We took a trip to San Fransisco to see a Star Wars exhibit. Drove there in a &#39;64-1/2 Mustang that had a power steering fluid leak. He&#39;s a leo. Our birthdays are a week apart. Which would make him 42 in about 3 weeks. He brought me back a statue of Bast from Israel, which I still have. He stayed with me for about a month after this trip to Israel. We had a fight about silly things - I felt like he was expecting me to act like his girlfriend while he was staying with me even though we weren&#39;t together. So I insisted that he move out. What are the chances that you are this guy? I know it&#39;s a long shot. It&#39;s a city of what, 5 million people? I&#39;m sure there are bound to be a few Morrissey fans. Though God knows why anyone would listen to that navel gazing drivel is beyond me. But just in case - Hey, NZ! I hope you&#39;re well. Sorry about that stupid fight that caused us to stop talking. It&#39;s been a long time. Do you still have the ring?</div>                 ')[0];

She said that I would be crazy and in need of therapy if I got angry with her. So, I was simply replying and explaining HOW I was scorned and WHY I wanted to reconnect. It doesn&#39;t matter anymore, I am removing BOTH replies in a matter of days. I am not getting anywhere in this and he already doesn&#39;t think of me anymore. Why should he? He has a family and his picture perfect life. I was just a mistake in judgment. One drunken what if is all I will EVER be to him and it is time I learned that. No matter what I felt, or how I felt, it is the truth. He moved on, so must I. Isn&#39;t it funny how the truth always is shown in love. The first to move on was the one least into it. That is why I am still hurting a decade later. They say you never get over your first. I can honestly say he was the first to make my palms sweaty and my knees weak. Does that mean anything? I don&#39;t know. Is love when you want to runaway and throw up? That is what it was like for me. I wanted to runaway and hide, throw up and was pinned in place. I felt fear shoot through me like I was being seen through my skin for some reason. In that instant my eyes and his locked, I felt all my walls fall down and felt totally exposed. Wouldn&#39;t you fight if that was all you knew? My whole life was nothing but pain. He was the first that didn&#39;t hurt. I thought he was hurting me, much like a scared animal does. I didn&#39;t understand he was helping me and i bit off the hand that fed me. I learned my lesson well. Now, I have to move on with my life with the knowledge that I have. I have no answers for where he is when his son asks. I guess that will have to be his due. He will one day want to know about this man, long after I am gone, and THAT is on my love. My love will have to answer the 70 questions I never had an answer for. That is what happens when you ghost on people. You hurt the ones that innocently loved you.</div>                 ')[0];

Writing has always saved me, and when it was the only thing I had left you took that away from me too. I was dumb to ever get involved with you, I sensed what you were about, but you were broken like me, and I wanted to fix you. All the signs were there, you weren&#39;t in recovery, you were a semi functioning addict, but that was familiar to me. So I ignored what was right infront of my face, and tried to make you better. I opened up to you about how fucked up my childhood was, and what it was like being the daughter of an addict, and you used that against me. You physically destroyed everything I had so I would become dependent on you. You would beat me, and lock me in the house for days and when you&#39;d finally let me out you&#39;d put trackers on my phone, and in my car, so I was constantly living in fear. You broke me down mentally and would have your junkie friends watch me sleep so I wouldn&#39;t try and escape while you were nodded out on the couch. You destroyed me in almost every viable sense, I could feel my soul dieing when I was around you. I wasn&#39;t the happy, feisty, care free wild spirit I used to be, I was your sad prisoner, and you loved that. You literally left me with nothing but my writing, it was my only escape, like it had always been; but you discovered that, And destroyed that too. i wanted to kill myself just to get away from you, this way I wouldn&#39;t give you the sick privilege of doing it for me, which you would have done had I not jumped out of that window and ran for my life. But a year and some change had passed since then, and though I was free of you, I wasn&#39;t really free. Even when you got out of jail and stopped stalking me, I Was still your prisoner... But I didn&#39;t realize that until today....I don&#39;t let any guy get close to me because I&#39;m still afraid. I act like I&#39;m strong, and everything is fine, but it&#39;s not. The moment I feel I could even potentially get close to someone I chase them away. You made me feel so powerless that I began to feel that the only way to exhibit my power is act as if nothing bothers me, but it&#39;s killing me inside. I&#39;m smart enough to get into people&#39;s heads and demonstrate the things they hate and fear the most in a person so they want nothing to do with me, but somehow until today I wasn&#39;t smart enough to realize how it was killing any hopes of happiness. I hate you right now, for all the awful things you&#39;ve done, I hate you for the monster you turned me into. I hate you for making me afraid. But I&#39;ve decided that I can&#39;t let that define me. Ive over come so much worse, and I became stronger and smarter as a result...and I can&#39;t let this be any different. I may always be slightly broken in someway, and that&#39;s ok. But what I realized was that I can&#39;t chase people away because I&#39;m afraid. I need to be loved, and not in the manipulative and backhanded way that I was always taught. I need to be truly loved and love someone in return...and just like the awful things that have come before you, I will over come it.... Speaking from a purely statistical sense, I should have lived and died in the sociological circumstances I was born into, but I didn&#39;t. I moved away from that to the other side of the country, I put myself through college and earned a masters degree... I became all the things my father didn&#39;t want me to become, In order to live with the same self hate that he couldnt escape. But I didn&#39;t become that, I didn&#39;t become the heartless person he tried to turn me into. I rose above that, and turned myself into the person that I wanted to be. And like him, going forward I will not allow you to turn me into a person that I hate. I don&#39;t deserve that, I deserve to be happy, and to be loved...and though most of the physical wounds you left on me healed a long time ago, the scars on my soul seem to linger, but I&#39;ll heal them, because I&#39;m stronger then that, and stronger then you. I write this now because I can, and you can&#39;t take that away from me ever again. This isn&#39;t to anyone in particular, I&#39;m just sending my thoughts into the universe, with the knowledge that my words will heal me.</div>                 ')[0];

I am looking for my lost love. I was scorned in that he just disappeared. I was hurt by men prior and after him. I nearly hate them. I miss him. He treated me like a princess and like I should have been and I was complete shit to him. I wanted to apologize to him, but I can&#39;t do that if he is a ghost. I wanted to stir the bees so to speak in telling him what he needed to hear. He needs to know that he has a child. A decade is a long time to look, don&#39;t you think? Don&#39;t you think he should know DESPITE the anger between us? I want him to forgive himself for what he never did. He thinks I blamed him, I never did. The problem was my ex that was psycho whom blew a car up to finally end his stalking and bs. That is why I finally am looking for him after all these years. Before that, I wasn&#39;t safe. Neither was my children, and he last knew I was in danger and moving east coast. I wanted to clear the air and offer closure for myself and him. I wanted to know if he truly hated me. Not a soul believes me where I come from. Back home, they all think me crazy to even speak of a man from here. Think about it, wouldn&#39;t you want to do the right thing, no matter the pain, or differences? I do, that is why I am looking. The post I did wasn&#39;t about being scorned, it was the truth. I told the story about how and what happened between us and how I felt after so long a silence. I need to know the truth, that is all I ask, is that too much? Maybe. However, I want HIM to tell me. It is HIS place to say, in this forum he could. That is why I CHOSE here, for HIS privacy. That way, he could talk to me on neutral territory and not risk misunderstandings. This forum is deadpanned. You don&#39;t know how to take something said. Clarification is best. When in doubt, or really hurt by what was said, ask first if that is what they meant, then blow up. This is missed connections, this is about hope. I HOPE to find the answer for my child. I HOPE to find my love and tell him about the missed connection he never knew he had. Didn&#39;t help I saw evidence of him having someone pregnant at the same time AND engaged to them. Didn&#39;t help that I got ZERO answers on if it was true, he just walked away when I asked. The last I saw him was his taillights in the dust driving off pissed as hell I even WENT there. Do you blame me?</div>                 ')[0];

A beautiful black woman with an accent, you were wearing a blue shirt and I don&#39;t really remember the pattern or design because you had gorgeous eyes. You said &#39;Hi&#39; to me and caught me completely off-guard. At the fix-up-your-drink-bar you attempted small talk again asking about my day. I fumbled through an answer and managed to ask about your day. You mentioned school and studying --upon reflection, I could have asked about your studies, but I&#39;m socially awkward and I was really distracted by your eyes. I walked out you told me to have a nice day in your heavenly accent. I parroted the sentiment back to you. I was wearing a purple shirt and have a head full of hair. I don&#39;t know if you were in to me, or just wanted some social interaction, but you put yourself out there and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t reciprocate like a fully-functioning adult. I walked back to look for you, but you were gone. I doubt this finds you, but if it does drop me a line. Your next cup is on me.</div>                 ')[0];

You were the very handsome, muscular light-skin guy, nice beard, at Micky&#39;s Saturday night 6/4 wearing a stylish sleeveless vest, form-fitting sweatpants and a flat-brimmed black and white baseball hat. You were with a couple of black friends. I saw you first upstairs as you were walking the dance floor, and then as I was leaving, you stopped me right by the entrance and politely told me &#34;I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re with someone here tonight, but I&#39;d like to take you to dinner&#34;. I told you my phone number but you couldn&#39;t hear me too well and then pulled your phone to write it down, but my friend kept tugging me and I didn&#39;t want to be rude to him and his female friend, so I left. You walked out and followed us a bit, but then you turned around as soon as we made a right turn on San Vicente. I&#39;m not seeing anyone and would absolutely love to have dinner with you! Long shot, but if you or your friends see this, PLEASE holler back and I&#39;d love to give you my phone number. Tell me what color was my shirt. I was the guy with the curly hair.</div>                 ')[0];

Well, it makes you appear to be the psychotic one instead of the one you keep posting about several times a day. You&#39;ve definitely had a connection, an obviously hurtful one, but what you&#39;re writing about is definitely not a missed connection. There are very few posts here in this section. Maybe because LA isn&#39;t a public transportation kind of town or because some Los Angelenos seem not very receptive to interacting with each other unless you&#39;re in the same business, clubs, or social circles already. So, your rantings about betrayal and hurt just seem out of place. I get that you want to vent and just get your feelings out, but there are more productive places like to friends or, better yet, to counselors. And in your case, maybe to the police, if you believe that your person has done such horrible things. Why am I writing you? Because this is a place for missed connections, for hope, for the off chance that that cute woman you connected eyes with just might look for you, for the hope that someone you have feelings for might acknowledge it anonymously, or possibly, just maybe, that you might have the strength and bravery to reach out and have hope that one of those of us who lurk here might just be the one that you want to respond back. And even though I don&#39;t truly believe that this will happen, I still read this section because, as Red says in the Shawshank Redemption, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. So, dear, hurt and betrayed, constant poster of late, maybe it&#39;s not the person you think that is flagging your posts. There are many women, like me, who read this section. To assume that only your person reads your posts and flags it shows just how out of place your posts are. So, maybe you should post in a different section, say, for example, the rants and raves section. Now, I have no hope whatsoever that you will do this. In fact, I pretty much believe that I, a stranger who only reads this section for the reasons listed above, will begin to soon be the receiver of your rants. But, then again, I&#39;m a bit of a sucker for hope. So, I can only hope that you are sane and will take this post as the gesture I intend and get some help from the police or friends or take your rantings elsewhere. Should I begin to be the receiver of your rants, then we will both know that you need more professional help. What good does it do you to wallow in your hate on Craigslist.....seriously, this is craigslist! And it&#39;s the missed connections section! Be well.</div>                 ')[0];

Not afraid to express our deeply rooted loves. In front of a crowd separate and stolid A relationship for sure, but I don&#39;t know what to call it Oceans of words have passed between us two Live river beds some lies some true The lies glittering and bright as there&#39;s no turning back The truths passionate and painful to pick up the slack This rose I saved for you you fondled so dearly Formaldehyde and ether to preserve it and clearly This theoretical potion by two aligned souls And you confide that you&#39;re weary of trolls Your secrets and your mystery you whispered to me Your shining star I didn&#39;t know I could be The light in the sky that guides you like a wire In the beginning who&#39;d have know we could fly higher Timidly lusting for your magic sentiments Wisely mistrusting your statured eminence Wisdom turned to folly when I&#39;d chosen the craft A thousand stepping stones you placed for the daft My nature perverted by a blameless taint But you can converted back with just a little paint I left you rusting so I could so conceal your breast With none other than me constantly pressed against your chest. Oh to be held and, oh so, tightly bound By your strong arm when no one is around You&#39;ve carried me half way there by the sound of your voice I&#39;ll erase all my mistakes when given the choice The second time around I&#39;ll call your name like a bell A ribbon of love to wrap around you like a spell And tie your hand to mine like a ring that does shine To prove how I&#39;ll love you forever, your mine Here I am your dolly for you to play Like what you accused me of just the other day None other for you none for myself I&#39;d live just for you like a high elf If you ever leave me I&#39;ll just spill my blood Following your footsteps along through the mud When your love wanes away for me there no point But what can&#39;t be cured by a brew and joint I don&#39;t smoke and I hate mirrors as well Missing your touch is my favourite hell Waiting for you is just as torturous yes But where you have been I can easily guess You&#39;re never too far when you circle around My little oasis here no the ground You leave me safe in my cocoon And when the time comes I&#39;ll spread my wings only for you. I love you and had to get this poem out.</div>                 ')[0];

The eye contact between us was intense. I think we just fit together perfectly. You&#39;re about the same height as me and seemed like you&#39;d love to primp with a vampire like me. I imagine our lives in a world with no men and I must say no one&#39;s quite turned me on like you.

As I went back to talk to you I saw some other stranger make a conversation with you. I saw you take off, and chased you into a crowd. I was hoping to get a name or something. Send me your info about what you had on. What was I wearing? or what race was I and my friend? You had my mind going so I had to post. I never do this. I ran into a shooting star on the way home. Hope this wish works. I was wearing a black LK shirt. You looked too amazing.</div>                 ')[0];

What we are is complicated and far beyond my ability of comprehension. I never know what you want from me. Is it sex? Is it friendship? Is it love? Is it all the above? Is it none? Why do you continue to speak to me? Why do you touch me with vehemence one day, then with bitter, chilled hands the next? If you care about me, why do you put me in this cyclical persecution? We talk, we flirt, we fuck, we ignore, we repeat -- that&#39;s how this thing goes between us. I used to have hope for something more to blossom. But with the inevitable process of aging, I realize this is going nowhere. Everyday I am more okay with the thought of that because I know we are in far too different places in our lives, and I am convinced we will be for a while. I love you inside and out. I love the scar on your shoulder, and the hair scattered across your chest. I love how you are filled with excitement at the sight of an animal, and I especially love how you&#39;re so dedicated to your family. Oh, how I adore how much you care for your younger sister. You&#39;re a spectacular brother, son, friend, and most importantly person. Anyone who has the privilege of knowing you is so blessed -- and I think this is where things go wrong between us. I admire you. I love you. I want to see you grow and prosper. However, these feelings are not reciprocated in the same fervor. I deeply understand why you would not want a relationship with me. And please do not take what I am about to say as me self-criticizing/presenting insecurities, no, no. Be aware that I am content with who I am, where I am, how I have been brought up, I love myself inside and out. But loving myself and acknowledging how we do not belong is the cold-hearted truth. You are smarter than me, and I am okay with that. You read the news, play sudoku, have intellectual conversations with your friends. I binge watch reality tv, I play mobile gamaes for fun, I talk to my friends about growing up. Once again we are in different places, and that&#39;s okay. The disparity between our personalities and situations vary far too much for comfort. I want to grow, not for you, for myself. I aspire to be at the level of intellect you are. (Also for myself) I thank you for being one of my biggest motivators. I love you, and you know that. I hate to end this so abruptly, but I feel as though I am being redundant. P.S. I hope you find this</div>                 ')[0];

Nope sorry to disappoint but I ain&#39;t he. This person I would compare more to wallpaper. You can hardly get a reading on her and she certainly wouldn&#39;t write a lengthy post like that, as she is or was a woman of few words. Pretty intelligent but sad about life and very very reserved. Textbook introvert all the way and introverts tend to be a bit selfish and self-centered naturally because they live sheltered in their own little worlds filling their own needs without a care in the world about others challenging them because they keep them at bay. From the little I read about you, it just doesn&#39;t seem like you come close. I want to say &#34;keep looking&#34; like most would, but I think the better thing is to meet a lot of guys and date as many as you can so you don&#39;t do anything foolish like I did when I put all my eggs in one basket shunning other girls I&#39;d meet. That was so no worth it! Good luck meeting your serial killer. :-D JK. Find one with a sense of humor too like I failed to do or you could end up with some weirdo.</div>                 ')[0];

I do not even know if you read these, but we met here many years ago... The years went so fast when we were together. The endless phone calls even before we met face to face. I should have kissed you that first night we met. For if I had, then we would have shared at least one more kiss. The many evenings of taking a nap after work so I would be awake upon your arrival. The many times we spent doing nothing more than sharing a few moments of peace from our busy worlds. The changes we made, the job I left to be with you. Then they split us apart. Made us go our own ways. We held onto hope that yet one day we would be back together. The years were two, the emptiness was no longer comforted by the hopes of your return. My heart ached, my room grew dim. We both knew what we had to do. Your situation, you have accepted. You have resigned your strength you never came to realize you have. The flame from the candle I hoped would lead you back to me from the darkness wavers. The wax is almost gone. My heart will always hold a special place for you. I will leave the light on. I will keep the phone near. No longer will I wait in the dark for your knock or call that I know now will never come. The two years I waited for you I will never get back. The memories of you I will never loose. That was all I could take with me as I began this new path. Those I cherish until the day that even life itself decides its my time to pass.</div>                 ')[0];

I wore my hair half way to my waist, striped blonde with teal green metallic eyeliner. I was depressed; for whatever reason. You asked me for a cigarette. I told you I didn&#39;t smoke. And then you miraculously copped a cig, (who are these smokers?). I said I would keep you company outside, anyways. Could it be that you looked passed the grimacing scowl? All it spoke, anyways, was my: tourettes-autism-chrohn&#39;sdisease-allergytogluten-cerebralpalsy-cysticfibrosis-rheumatoidarthritis-ADHD-andhypochondria. I am predisposed to dismiss immediate niceness as a character weakness, but I would forgive you, I guess, if you would only explain the thinking behind these manners. I only remember relating that flying planes had always been my most intense yearning, save having 20.5/20 vision and the fact that I&#39;m apt to get vertigo from riding on the bus, but that I&#39;m proactively inclined to embrace any preoccupying prospect on a whim, no matter how unrealistic. Althought, TBS was OTS and BVSC was on the SS, i think I still felt BPA, or felt that I should be feeling BPA, briefly, and I tried my best to express this. Which is GAP. Now that I think about it, I can&#39;t remember your exact sentiments, and that I would like to explore, although I&#39;m predominantly concerned-about-saving-face, the unknown territory in this MC. I just want you to know this, that if I BTH it was an accident. I was lame, and for that I apologize. I&#39;m high-strung first and foremost, but behind that facade I&#39;m an animal, trained and trusted, but an animal nonetheless. I think that neatly explains my selective memory and undispelled need to just blurt out the first thing that pops into my head. My intention is not to bamboozle or confound you, and I would expect the same courtesy, if this weren&#39;t such a long shot. All I can do, is put this message out into the universe and hope it somehow reaches the right person, however slim the chances of this may be. And I already feel stupid enough, as it is. So, if you DO see this, PLEASE, don&#39;t give me a hard time. If this sounds familiar to you, message me with what you were wearing.</div>                 ')[0];

It just makes me think like are whole friendship was bullshit. you got what you wanted from me and dipped. I understand im young and probably seem immature but I was working on it. Like I got that fire back after the last time i seen you. and you just left me. Yeah i know the post,, and you seen my pics, but i needed money! you probably wont believe it but i didnt even meet anybody off that post because right after you seen it i took it down. but my question is why where you even looking? i guess i wasent good enough. i just cant believe your completely out my life.. you wont answer my calls or text over that stupid post. but you said you dont care what i do!!! did you really like me? you only wanted me to want you huh? i did and i still do. i want you bad! im want you. i really do but i know you wont respond to my text or call so im in limbo. Each day will be easier to forget you. I mean CL isnt the place to find love anyways. I hope you see this. I miss you my friend M.E.T + (Trey) AkA S</div>                 ')[0];

You aren&#39;t answering texts or e-mails. When we connected on &#34;that dating site&#34; (that is a clue for you), we both thought it was good. Unfortunately, what transpired led to some very bad things. You see, I believed you when you said you read &#34;Black Devil Spine&#34; and were into it (another clue for you). I wouldn&#39;t have tried what I did if you hadn&#39;t of said that. After you pushed me away you confessed to not having read it and only knew of the description. When you looked into it more on your phone, you flipped. You said you were calling the police. I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t, but you also didn&#39;t give me much of a chance to explain. Your hasty retreat was understandable, but I&#39;m not a bad guy. I thought we were into the same things. You led me to believe that. I stopped when you said &#34;no.&#34; I have the e-mails where you said, &#34;I love the book and want to live it.&#34; What was I supposed to think. Honestly, I thought it was too good to be true, but we met anyway. During dinner at that bad Mexican place (third and final clue), you told me how you got into the book, but never offered specifics. I should&#39;ve known. A girl looking like you ... that just doesn&#39;t happen. But, I let my dick rule and got excited about the possibilities. I confess, had I used my head, I would&#39;ve known you were playing me because I have a very good job, a nice car, and I probably seemed too good to be true to you, too. Unfortunately, again, all that I posted was true. I never misrepresented myself. I apologize for acting how I did. I think by the time you left you understood it was a miscommunication. Here is the thing, I&#39;d like to meet again under normal circumstances and see where it goes. I understand if you don&#39;t. I totally understand it. You were funny, sweet and gorgeous, and you know how to tell a ribald tale. I like that in a woman. Let me know if it is too late to have a second first chance.</div>                 ')[0];

I was already in the elevator, head down, looking at my phone, when you entered from a floor below mine. You initiated some small talk, I engaged you in conversation, and it was very, very nice. I awkwardly walked along with you after we exited into the lobby, anticipating your sudden break-off because of my concern that I was creeping you out by walking along with you, but you kept on walking with me, trying to keep the convo going. I then awkwardly initiated a break-off at the parking structure and have felt weird about it ever since. I was totally into your friendly demeanor and positive energy.

I just wanted to let you know that I haven&#39;t been wasting my time. I&#39;m always so concerned with self-improvement to where it creates rivalries, but as for me, I can now kick a beat on a full drum kit and I&#39;ve been working on improving my drum rolls and solos on my pearl kit. I&#39;m trying to get a hold of the hunger games books so I can find out how it all ends and also to decide what I&#39;m going to do with the rest of my grandma&#39;s birthday money. I&#39;m caught between buying a few more games for my laptop or getting a snakebite piercing and trying to decide which one to put off for later. I miss you and I have a lot of things to share which I can&#39;t put in a post. If you need to talk to me I&#39;ll be where I usually am, putting additions on my crusader castles, battling the hordes of hell, or tending my plants. PS. Once I didn&#39;t sleep for four months and The Force sent me a picture of the universe. It&#39;s a continuous loop made of heavy metals with 52 links, wider at the top and narrower in the middle like a Fibonacci strip but without the cross over or a bent up classic telephone receiver. I have several sketches of it. PPS. Tomorrow I will be organizing my MP3 players all day so I might be unreachable.</div>                 ')[0];

You&#39;re not a runner, but you run. I&#39;m not a runner either, but I run too. I&#39;m not a photographer, but I take photos sometimes. I&#39;m not a writer, yet I write.

Yet more beautiful is the one who&#39;s not a runner, but runs. With leaden legs and burning lungs at whatever pace he can muster. Pounding the earth with his burdened body. Never giving up, he runs into his pain. Tears welled in my eyes. I see you, red running man. Become the beast you were meant to be!</div>                 ')[0];

You know I love you. We talked about that earlier today even though you told me that you don&#39;t just want to talk anymore. You said things are getting hard and it&#39;s getting harder to maintain this long distance relationship you said you can&#39;t do this anymore. I asked you if you still loved me and you just reasserted that you can&#39;t do this anymore. This is all my fault. You could have chosen anyone else. Anyone who doesn&#39;t have a warped mind who can control their impulses but you chose me and I&#39;m so thankful that you did. Even if it doesn&#39;t work out you&#39;ve given me the best three years of my life and I&#39;m so grateful for that. You also confided that you&#39;re a jealous guy and you want to be the only one for me. And also while we&#39;re on this subject, I wonder if I could borrow the stick you use to beat them back with. If you could solve this problem for me, it&#39;d just be a reminder of how good you are to me.</div>                 ')[0];

Every day I put on the lie that I&#39;ve moved on and I&#39;m doing great now, but if I&#39;ve moved on, why do I still think about you every day and every hour. I dream about you every night. I want to stop thinking about you. I know I was too busy with school, trying to rebuild my life and career to make a better life for us..and I did it and I got there. I have that side of success, but I was working for us. I promised you I&#39;d get myself together after. I knew I would. If we could just wait a few months, I&#39;d prove to you what we struggled for during that time - why I worked so hard, why I was SO dedicated. I accomplished it, but it was bittersweet when you weren&#39;t there to tell me how you were proud of me. I mentally pictured looking off stage to see you smiling at me the entire time I struggled. All my sleepless nights I thought of that moment, making you proud. Making our lives better together. Us looking back and saying, &#34;I can&#39;t believe we went through that.&#34; My willpower was stronger than yours though. You broke down before the finish line. I&#39;m still in the race. It&#39;s hard to think about carrying on with this life without you. I turn to tell you our inside jokes and you&#39;re not there. I say the things that would make you smile and giggle, and nobody thinks it&#39;s funny or amusing. It was our thing and no one else&#39;s. You were my drive and it&#39;s hard to work hard when it&#39;s not for us. I do it though so it wasn&#39;t all for nothing, but I want you on my side again. I know you won&#39;t be though. I&#39;ll see this to myself, I&#39;ll keep thinking about you, I&#39;ll consider calling you every day to meet me, and I won&#39;t do it. I&#39;ll keep wishing I could carry you to bed and kiss you and tuck you in when you fall asleep in front of the tv. I&#39;ll keep wishing I could make a dumb household repair for you and be your man, protect you through everything. I&#39;ll keep wishing I could grow old with you. I&#39;d kill for you to hog the bed one more time next to me...I regret getting frustrated and shoving you away instead of cherishing the moments knowing that you&#39;re just that much closer to me while we sleep. I regret my arms falling away from you while I slept. I&#39;d kill for to have that time back. That was home. You were my home. We were a family. I love you, I always will.</div>                 ')[0];

Ever since you stopped messaging Toronto with our status updates I miss you even more. Even though we talk I miss reading your posts it like post-its when you live and work together. I cant wait for the days when we&#39;re living together and I&#39;m free to live with you. I imagine all the cuddling and nuzzling, walking the dog, ?feeding the cats. Your so good to me. Even when I&#39;m being a bitch. Although I wouldn&#39;t mind being your bitch. I like it when you put your hand on the back of my collar, the choke chain I wear. As compared to the bicycle chain you wear. I guess I&#39;m the bitch. Definitely the bitch. My necklace screams &#34;own me&#34; yours screams &#34;ride me&#34; It think it matches well. And the pillow talk, and the video games. PS I&#39;ll be a poop face until I reach 30. I&#39;m not there yet. Mentally. I&#39;m still looking for the bottom of the well of immaturity. Many think that it has been found but the only don&#39;t know how wrong there are. There is still digging left to be done.

Before I completely embarrass myself and start posting my original songs I was wondering if you could shed some light on what my dad meant when he whispered that he was a double-lifer and secondly where we first met? Was it that chatroom? Were you hurt when I lied and said I was a guy. It turned into my favourite fantasy. You reach down into my pants and find nothing, no dick no balls. What tipped you off was it a hint of a breast in my shirt or a feminine smell but you find out that your best friend and most obnoxious rival is truly a girl. For those old enough to remember, before android there was MSN chat. And before google you used to have to start your computer from MS Dos. The Marilyn Manson ate my balls page and before that there were Doc Martens, flannel shirts and Moist and Our Lady Peace. My mind is doing back flips to figure you out. Did my dad bring my pixel painted flowers to work to show off and that&#39;s how you learned about me. So proud of me I didn&#39;t have any mistakes back then. Are you looking for me? This is my favorite picture. Such angelic eyes and such a warm innocent genuine smile. What a beautiful boy. Lastly are you mad about T. Remember I have a ring of truth.</div>                 ')[0];

I was literally tearing up at the end. Waiting for a time when we can actually be together is so torturous. I wish I had a time machine so I could travel into the past or into the future where we can be together. I named this post pigeons because their cooing reminds me of you. You&#39;re literally the best most patient most forgiving most loving human being that I&#39;ve ever met and I never want to hurt you again by promising to leave you so I could return to my solitary cocoon. I promise to give up my idealization of loneliness and devote all my time to pleasing you and fulfilling your wishes. Like a genie in a bottle? I wished for you once a long time ago but I never knew a person like you could be attracted to and devoted to a person like me and I&#39;m starting to wish for you again, every day and to wish for your happiness and health. You&#39;ve literally changed me. The loving person I am today is all because of you and the kindness and friendship you showed me. I swear it hurts to be apart from you and waiting seems to take forever. At least I have school now to keep me busy. Are you okay? Do you miss me too much? If you want to be free, I&#39;d set you free even thought I&#39;d miss you. I just want you to be happy. I&#39;d do anything for you or to please you. Please let me know if I&#39;m making you miserable or upset and I&#39;ll change. You are the sweetest, kindest, most patient human being I&#39;ve ever met. I love you so much.</div>                 ')[0];

I returned the greeting and as you turned to walk away, I commented on how fantastic your ass looked, again. You stopped and came back to me telling me you weren&#39;t drunk. We shook hands and you asked if I really liked your body. I replied with &#39;hell ya&#39; and I&#39;d love to see more of it. You hugged me, tightly, and feeling your tight body against mine gave me an instant boner. But, the bus came and I had to get on it.

Thank you. Your beautiful smile ALWAYS makes my days better. Life for me aint that great right now but you have cheered me up more times than you know by simply smiling at me. That smile, those eyes. A few days back I had a very very bad day, things were hopeless.. I happened to be passing by Carls so I decided to get something. I could barely keep my voice together but I ordered, pulled up, and there you were. For just a few minutes, you just made everything so much better. I owe you so much for that day and every other day I get to see you. So thanks. Thank you for cheering me up. A beautiful girl like you deserves the world for it, really. I hope life treats you well. I guess ill keep trying to hide that butterfly feeling I get whenever I hear your voice through the intercom.</div>                 ')[0];

She was looking at some sunglasses after the ride, and she said, &#34;anything that doesn&#39;t make my eyes look like I should have a beard,&#34; or something like that. She was white and very cute. I smiled at her and she kind of blushed and smiled while looking away and it made my heart melt. She was a teenager, surely younger than 18, but probably older than 15. I was wearing a white bucket hat with a lot of D&#39;s on it, a black My Chemical Romance shirt, black ripped jeans, and high top shoes. I have long hair and glasses, I am 16 years old and I have a lip piercing on the right side of my face. I was with the short chubby guy who also had glasses, but short hair. Pls help.</div>                 ')[0];

If you can&#39;t tell it to me straight or explain it to me like a 5 year old I don&#39;t want to hear it. I loved reading your personal poems and got excited getting to see that aspect of your creativity. I didn&#39;t go back and read the older ones because I didn&#39;t want to look into your past. I was excited to hear your fresh, creative, intelligent, outlook though. I know I have challenged you on opening up to the beauty of not hiding behind intimate details. It is by no means, me trying to change you. I wanted you to be more open so people can get to know and accept the girl I fell in love with. I wanted to confirm to myself that she was still in there too, for my own self assurance. I was worried that getting out of touch meant losing the &#39;girl&#39; I know. If that is selfish, then I am guilty of being selfish. I love being a little out there. We both are, we both aren&#39;t bothered by that, and I think it is beautiful. We both are way too stubborn and way too committed to our principles. I just wanted more. If that makes me.... what ever it is. Then I guess I am that. ........ I miss you!</div>                 ')[0];

I cannot believe I got so shy like that! I was at Universal City Walk yesterday with a group of relatives. You are a VERY cute twink, you look about 18-19 and have short blonde hair, blue eyes, a gorgeous face and a smooth, lean body. I&#39;m a tall, sort of husky, handsome bear type with very short dark brown hair, brown eyes and mild facial scruff, in my upper 30s (but I get told I look younger sometimes). I was hanging out with a group of relatives in front of the Hard Rock Cafe. You were with a small group of people around your age. I noticed you kept staring at me. I looked back at you and our eyes locked for a moment. It sent tingles up my spine. You started coming closer and had your attention on me but didn&#39;t say anything. We loked at each other again. This time you smiled and winked. I casually walked over to your direction and lightly brushed up against you. You responded by doing the same, sort of grinding on me. Your group started walking away and calling out to you. I should have spoken and had us exchange numbers in that brief window of opportunity but I&#39;m very discreet and not out and didn&#39;t want to do so in front of my relatives. I&#39;m so regretful though. You are so hot and there was an unmistakable attraction between us. I&#39;ve had you on my mind all night and day. This is a total long shot, I know, but I figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt for me to post it here. I am HOPING you see this. I have a thing for cute blonde twinks, you don&#39;t even know. If you see this, please contact me. I want to make out with you passionately and kiss you and feel you all over. And see how things go from there. ;)</div>                 ')[0];

You had an insanely perfect body with a matching tremendous physical beauty. I simply couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of you each time I encountered you and I know you noticed it as well. I wanted to say something to you, in fact, I did (in the produce department) but I noticed you were wearing headphones and immediately understood why you didn&#39;t respond. But I did notice your &#39;not so casual&#39; glancing at me. You were apparently having problems paying for your food at the checkout line because you had to make a phone call to someone to ask them a question. As I was leaving, you walked passed me without your groceries in hand and kept looking back at me. I wanted to catch up to you and offer to pay for your food since I got the jest that you couldn&#39;t do it on your own - but you were much faster than me. As I was walking to my car, you were looking back at me while you turned the corner... I called out to you, but as the headphones suggest, you probably couldn&#39;t hear me. If by chance you see this message - I&#39;d relish the opportunity to physically (sexually) please you and be please by you. Your body and face are absolutely stellar in every way possible and I certainly want to explore it. More times than just one. We could do dinner, movies, night in, whatever - I&#39;m more interested in getting to you know you on a personal level AND rock your world in the sack. So - IF by chance you see this message, please respond with what you asked when you were on the phone - it pertained to the credit card you were using to pay for it. There was a specific question that I overheard you ask - tell me what it was. Then, maybe, we can set up a casual meeting and check out the physical chemistry. I know that I am attracted to you in every way imaginable and would totally love to make you smile. Maybe, eve, make it a lifetime thing. If your personality is even half as awesome as your body, there is no way I would ever want to let you get away - nor would I ever do anything to push you away... thus, the reason for this post. For the record, this was not today or yesterday - this was a few days ago - if you can respond with which day this was, the color of your hair, the style of your hairdo or the items that you were attempting to purchase, that would also help me know it&#39;s really you.

I came back from college and tried to get in contact with you but by then, you had changed your number and moved. I went to your apartment to say hi but your powerpuff girls mat was missing and so was your composting bins so I had to find another way to get in touch with you. Im really sorry for the way I acted that day. I was a young immature boy and I hurt your feelings as a result. Hurting you is one of my life&#39;s biggest regrets because you did not deserve it and it breaks my heart every time I recall that memory. I so badly wanted to apologize to you in person but just couldn&#39;t. It took me too long to really appreciate the times we had together and how we really complimented one another. I want to make it up to you somehow and make things right. I at least want to apologize in person if nothing else. You are a smart and wonderful person and so good at killing zombies.</div>                 ')[0];

I stood where the biker passengers usually stand with their bikes. I didn&#39;t notice you until I found an open seat. you were sitting on the seat that have priority for the elderly and disabled. That&#39;s when I saw your fiery red hair. At first I wasn&#39;t paying attention but I noticed that our eyes made contacted. You started blushing like a tomato and tried to hide your face, it was very cute all the while trying to catch peak of me. You wore classes, had thick-full red hair. Also were navy blue scrubs and converse-style sneaks (black) no laces. As riders boarded the train to north hollywood I noticed you trying to get a glimpse of me. I was too shy to say anything and it&#39;s my deepest regret not saying anything as you tried to reach out to me when we exited the train. You stood about 5&#39; 7&#34; or 5&#39; 8&#34; next to me (5&#39; 10&#34;) before the doors opened. You then went up the escalator out towards vermont/sunset never to see you again. I hope we get a chance to meet again. I know we were both extremely shy I clammed up real bad too. I hope you can remember me though it&#39;s a long shot. I had hair length down to my neck, wore a black shirt, pair of jeans and vans sneakers that day if that&#39;s any help. Message me if you do remember. I do recall you had a badge for children&#39;s hospital it must&#39;ve been one-in-a-million running into you. I hope not. :)</div>                 ')[0];

It&#39;s faster than drawing, or about the same amount of time since I made sure you look perfect. I know that hand-drawing shows a lot of heart, but my way still shows empathy right :D? Forgive me though, this is my memory of you from 2013. I hope you&#39;ll appreciate it. Hello Michelle. I&#39;m sorry that you have to find me through here as I don&#39;t know how else to reach you properly. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 years since we last met and I still remember us! Yet again, I&#39;ve been nostalgic of you. My memories of us have haunted me this whole week (at the time of editing). My mind toys with me, taking a section of a recalled past and improvise imaginations of myself in a more social persona towards you, to have socialized with you. I&#39;m disturbed and profound of my fears relating to memories of you, and I apologize because I believe it may have been a stressor triggered by my work. You are the missing piece of my puzzle, of my inner self, which I must face, with kindness and forwardness of course. Simply put, I&#39;ve been beating myself over and over for not having the confidence to ask you out. I want to hear from you again, this time maybe we can actually keep in touch instead. We have never talked and I don&#39;t think it bites to give each other a chance to express ourselves. It was spring semester, February 2013 . . . I was one of the few late students to come into our classroom of the Chemistry department. Internally, I was frantic because most seats were filled and people looking at me, but I tried calmly to go to the seat behind you. Once I calmed myself in the already quiet room, I finally noticed you. You were very intriguing even though I hadn&#39;t seen your face yet. I did enjoy your black outfit. It was your dyed hair that sort of excited me, portrayed who you were. I like goth/punk/alternative girls even though I don&#39;t dress like one. I had an urge to befriend you in the awkwardly quiet classroom as we waited for our professor. He did come late, and handed out the syllabus. I waited for mine as the stack of paper from our column got passed down. You got one next, proceeded to hand me one by turning around from your seat, and that&#39;s when our eyes met. How could I forget that moment? Your crystal blue eyes pierced my stare, looked as if you wanted a good image of who I am too. Did I notice a slight smile too? I was most surprised because I usually don&#39;t get that kind of greeting, and it was refreshing. My apologies that I forgot to thank you for the syllabus. For the rest of the class time, I imagined scenarios where we finally got some small talk going. And what lovely hair you had...it didn&#39;t make me turn away as you might had assume for people around you. First day of class was over and you packed quicker than me and left. On the day before Valentine&#39;s, despite the fact that you changed your seat in class, we met face to face once again in the Red Line station. Damn, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to ask you out. At the elevator, you had a serious look on your face and I wasn&#39;t sure if you were annoyed by me. My train goes towards Union Station, and yours toward North Hollywood. We stood with our backs to each other at first. I saw you talking with a blind man and it made me realize there&#39;s kindness in you. Your light rail came early and you boarded. I believe you were looking at me and I looked back too. That was the last time I ever saw you before the final exam of our class... If you&#39;re truly the girl I&#39;ve talked about, please reply with the professor&#39;s name of our class or the course name with the number after it, and the first letter of your last name (because our professor always do that in roll call).</div>                 ')[0];

Man was I surprised when you followed me to the filthy bathroom of a bar and tried to take my piss. I told you to get up, who the fuck does that, you knew me for a 20 minute conversation and you are going to suck my piss dripping cock in your nice work clothes? You were so cute and pathetic. You said you wanted me to dominate you and that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand erect. Hours later Id be slamming your hot little stinky hole with my cock. You were a trooper. Highlight- when you are telling me you can&#39;t take my dick anymore but the dick pig in you wont let you give up so you keep slamming down while you ride me until I blow in your hole. I was drunk and your number didn&#39;t save. So send me a photo and lets do it again.</div>                 ')[0];

So you&#39;ve been warned...lol I was grocery shopping in the Porter Ranch Walmart yesterday (Saturday). I wanted a particular item in the frozen food. There was an elderly, disabled lady with a walker standing in front of the case I wanted to get into. She was there for quite some time. I went ahead and looked at other items in that aisle while I waited to get into the case. When she moved I got the item I wanted and went on with my shopping. A few minutes later, you, the girl in the green shirt with writing on it, approached me and said, &#34;I just wanted to thank you for being patient with my mother&#34;. I was somewhat taken aback and said something stupid like, &#34;think nothing of it, it was no big deal&#34;. I feel like I should have said more to you, because I know it was a big deal to you. But here&#39;s the thing, I&#39;m by nature kind of shy and leery of strangers approaching me so I didn&#39;t know how to react. Especially in a place like Walmart, where when a stranger approaches you they usually want money or to have you donate to some bogus &#34;charity&#34;. I felt bad later and thought about the encounter and wish I had talked to you because now I feel like you were a very nice person reaching out to another person. I realize now that you are probably your mother&#39;s care taker and probably have a somewhat difficult time of it. I know that, because when my mom was dying of cancer I took care of her, and it&#39;s a sacrifice. But here&#39;s why I treated your mother like I did. Elderly, disabled, and with a walker, she is still a valuable human being. She has the same right to shop as anybody else. The little effort that it took from me to show her patience and respect was nothing compared to the difficulty that I know she has just getting around. The truth is, when I saw your mom, I thought about my own mom, and realized a lot of things that only you and I understand. One last thing, I think you&#39;re a hero for caring for your mom. I wish I had talked to you a little bit. I know this is a lame and sappy posting, but I felt compelled to write it. Maybe somebody will read it and spread some kindness. If any of you internet trolls respond to this in a negative manner, please use correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.</div>                 ')[0];

We made eye contact off and on, but neither of us said anything to one another. You were entertaining your daughter in line as you waited. Then by pure chance or coincidence we were parked next to one another in the parking lot. As I was getting in my car, you were loading up your car, and you saw me checking you out as I was pulling out of my parking space. You had black sweats on, and there was something very sexy about you. I was driving a black Prius. As I pulled around the parking lot to pull out you were putting your cart back, and we both caught one another making eye contact. We both stared back at one another as you were in your car and I was pulling out onto Figueroa. We both smiled and waived at one another as I turned onto the road and drove off. You were very sexy, and I was trying not to stare at your curves. I thought by some wild chance that maybe you might look on here? I am 5&#39;11&#34; and have wavy/curly brownish hair.</div>                 ')[0];

In those 10 years we had some awesome times, and some that weren&#39;t so great. You taught me a great deal about myself and offered me a different perspective than i had ever considered before. You were everything that i ever wanted or needed. You were my dream girl. I love you with all that i am- unconditionally. Yous aid some things to me that hurt me so badly that i can&#39;t get past it. Well I spent several hours writing the perfect post and I accidentally hit the wrong key and poof it was gone....so I guess that means I should just get to the point: (or points): *I love you with all my heart and I am completely lost without you *You left me in a horrible nightmare situation that I can&#39;t deal with anymore *I have no desire to be with anyone else but you, so it seems likely that I will be alone until I die. *You think that I have or am working against you-completely false, I am completely on your team. *You might think you have no money, but there is $2300 on your debit card that is available to you *I will be in LA on Sept 1st; I will be at the entrance to the Santa Monica Pier at 9am (unless I see you before that). Please meet me there. *This trip will cost me everything I have left. I won&#39;t be returning to Iowa...This is my &#34;last hurrah&#34;... My phone number has changed, the same area code but the number is now five, 56, two zero 52. I want you to call me if at all possible. You are angry with me over things i have not even done. I am about complete honesty at this point-I have no reason to lie about anything. I just know that I can&#39;t live with you thinking that I don&#39;t love and care about you. There is not a moment that goes by that I don&#39;t think about you. I hope you will contact me. If you know AEM, please pass this on to her.</div>                 ')[0];

We were both very close when we were walking inside. I mentioned that the weather was finally cooling off some and you said that you didn&#39;t think it was that bad when it was hotter because you are originally from North Carolina. You had the lovely accent. We entered the store and went our ways. I couldn&#39;t get you off my mind so after perusing some books and wandered around looking for you but couldn&#39;t find you. I couldn&#39;t get that pretty smile out of my mind and your body is amazing. I eventually left the store and saw that your blue mustang was still parked there. Maybe you went to another one of the stores in the shopping center. I decided I would leave you a note on your windshield. I directed you to check out the missed connections here and I would place this ad with a little more about me. I did notice you had a wedding band on so if there is any attraction then I know I would be limited in regards to relationship. That being said, the best I can hope for is more of a sexual fwb type of situation so I will gear my comments more in that direction. I am late 40&#39;s, professional, no kids, single and flexible schedule. I am an oral master. I am incredibly talented and would absolutely love to show just how talented I am. I know many men claim to be but I assure you, I live up to what I say. I would love to buy you a drink or do happy hr when you can get away and learn a bit more about each other and go from there. I could tell when you looked at me that there was SOMETHING there. A spark. Lets see if that spark turns to fire. I hope to hear from you.</div>                 ')[0];

He was from Lancaster and we later traveled there with Rachel after a few weeks together in Santa Monica. He had a friend named Jordy (from Lancaster). They both liked, Iron Maiden. Jordy had shaggy brown hair and his parents were military. Paul had blonde hair and blue eyes and I think he was tall and medium build. He always wore a Levi denim jacket with the sheep skin on the inside. I believe Paul and Jordy went to HS in Lancaster. . . Making them around 17-20 years old in 1990.

You were the only one that witnessed the most intense, nastiest, fall, crash, spill accident pretty much I&#39;ve ever had. We were at Manhattan beach, 25th street, at around 10 pm last night on August 3rd. I was riding my skateboard straight down the hill, expecting to be able to turn left on a street on the way down, but i ended up going to fast and ended up going down the next two hills and couldn&#39;t stop. i passed you up on the way down and you saw me go over the 11 step stairs at the bottom of the hill. i was hoping to god there was sand on the other side of the stairs at least but nope.. straight black asphalt .. you were the only one the saw this happen. You came over and stood on top of the stairs n slight shock.. and asked, are you ok, which my dumbass replied that i was perfectly fine in a sarcastic, nonchalant, melancholy tone.. you asked if i needed your help and my dumbass said no.. I should have said yes, I need a nurse, If i would have answered the way i was thinking in my head i would&#39;ve said yes and you could have been my angelic nurse, but because i was in excruciating pain the words no im alright came out my mouth as more of an automatic response. my friends that showed up right after our brief conversation as i was lying on the ground in silent agony; said i should have asked you for CPR, but due to my excruciating pain, my &#34;improv game&#34; was totally fucked as i was wondering if i had internal bleeding , and if my rib caged burst or if i had any broken bones, fractured wrist or ribs aaanndd if my heart was still beating.. ssooo I really wished i would have said yes and let you help me because then i would have been able to talk to you about it later, like today i wanted to call you and say thank you and ask you about what it looked like from your pov since you were the only one there to witness it. yes im still in great pain but thank god i didnt have to go to the ER which I probably should have honestly. My whole body is stiff right now and aches, my chest is sore and probably bruised and my back too, i felt my chest expand by the way i landed basically my chest broke my fall so .. that happened. im sure by the way you saw me fall and at the speed i was going that I was fucked up but i wanted to say thank you and you were sweet to ask if i was ok and for your concern. I do want to find you. I hope you find this. I hope this finds you..

While there, I came across a post about a woman looking for a date for a friends wedding. She had lost both her arms to a childhood disease. I was struck by her beauty and tenacity, but never wrote her to offer myself as a date. I&#39;m not sure why I never wrote her. However, I&#39;m seeking her out now. I&#39;m not a creep, or a freak, and don&#39;t desire anything deviant from her. I do think about her often and wonder if she ever found her date and whether she had a good time at the wedding. I thought I would try to seek her out using Craigslist since this is the place where I found her add. If you find this post mystery girl, or if anyone knows her please write me an email. I don&#39;t want anything accept to meet her and maybe enjoy a cup of coffee with her. If it matters, I&#39;m a tall handsome guy who is well educated. I enjoy the company of real people, and wonder far too often about the &#34;big things&#34; in life. Here&#39;s to the serendipitous of every day life.</div>                 ')[0];

We crossed each other in the aisle couple of times. You in high heel sandals, skirt, printed blouse, beautiful dark brown auburn hair (am not 100% sure if they were tied back or not, but am 100% sure that you looked beautiful and of course your absolutely yummy lips). I wanted to strike up a small conversation starting with a hello but did not want to jolt you, so I kept to myself. (Or maybe I just backed out.) I headed for the check out counter. You came in right behind. While I was still putting things in my bag, you were checking out and used your debit card. (Yea, I heard you say that to the girl.) Then we both walked to our vehicles. I got into my black SUV. You got into your white Toyota Camry. You drove off in one direction. Me in the other. End of story? End of our Brief Encounter? No, please no. Wish I had talked to you. It was not so difficult. I just made it very difficult. And now am hoping against hope that you read this posting, just out of the blue...

I drove to your area from Santa Monica and we went to very nice French/ Italian restaurant where you told me about your music,your family and the many types of sage plants. After dinner, we went back to your flat where you briefly taught me how to play drums. We hung out at your flat for a bit before we made some tea and took a beautiful night-time stroll along the pier ( good thing I was wearing my green/white chucks) After or date, you gave me flowers- so sweet then we kissed each other good night. You were so sweet! If I remember correctly, you live (d) on Broadway ( 2-3 blocks of walking distance from the pier) and the restaurant we went to was named Domique&#39;s kitchen ( I just googled searched the hell out of this place) At the time, I was using this crappy windows Lumia phone and apparently nothing was saved to the phone- it&#39;s just shit! We made other plans to see each other again but things were happening back home in my family and I had to leave. I&#39;m now back in LA and hoping that once again, we can meet. I know it&#39;s been a very long time and you probably have moved on and have been on many dates since then, but in the chance that you are still single- please reach out. If you find this, please reply to me. I&#39;m the Nigerian girl who burnt her tongue with the hot tea. I may have to sign up on Tinder again just to find you :) Cheers!</div>                 ')[0];

I was wearing a light grey patterned suit with a blue tie; Man bag at my side. I got on the wrong train heading to North Hollywood and ran into you. There you sat, also dressed nice, and I was caught off guard. I didn&#39;t know what to say. Sadly, I was distracted by the fact that I was on the wrong train...and rushed off to catch the next one heading back. When I boarded the correct train, I turned to see where you had gone. There you were again, this time smiling at me...and you waved. I should have gotten off that train. Opportunity lost, missed connection. Where are you now? - Blue Tie</div>                 ')[0];
